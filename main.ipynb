I also heard that at first it was seized by U.S. customs if it ever tried to enter this country, therefore being a fan of films considered \"controversial\" I really had to see this for myself.<br /><br />The plot is centered around a young Swedish drama student named Lena who wants to learn everything she can about life. In particular she wants to focus her attentions to making some sort of documentary on what the average Swede thought about certain political issues such as the Vietnam War and race issues in the United States. In between asking politicians and ordinary denizens of Stockholm about their opinions on politics, she has sex with her drama teacher, classmates, and married men.<br /><br />What kills me about I AM CURIOUS-YELLOW is that 40 years ago, this was considered pornographic. Really, the sex and nudity scenes are few and far between, even then it\\'s not shot like some cheaply made porno. While my countrymen mind find it shocking, in reality sex and nudity are a major staple in Swedish cinema. Even Ingmar Bergman, arguably their answer to good old boy John Ford, had sex scenes in his films.<br /><br />I do commend the filmmakers for the fact that any sex shown in the film is shown for artistic purposes rather than just to shock people and make money to be shown in pornographic theaters in America. I AM CURIOUS-YELLOW is a good film for anyone wanting to study the meat and potatoes (no pun intended) of Swedish cinema. But really, this film doesn\\'t have much of a plot.'"

Really, the sex and nudity scenes are few and far between, even then it\\'s not shot like some cheaply made porno. While my countrymen mind find it shocking, in reality sex and nudity are a major staple in Swedish cinema. Even Ingmar Bergman, arguably their answer to good old boy John Ford, had sex scenes in his films.<br /><br />I do commend the filmmakers for the fact that any sex shown in the film is shown for artistic purposes rather than just to shock people and make money to be shown in pornographic theaters in America.

about certain political issues such as the vietnam war and race issues in the united states  in between asking politicians and ordinary denizens of stockholm about their opinions on politics  she has sex with her drama teacher  classmates  and married men  br    br   what kills me about i am curious yellow is that 40 years ago  this was considered pornographic  really  the sex and nudity scenes are few and far between  even then it s not shot like some cheaply made porno  while my countrymen mind find it shocking  in reality sex and nudity are a major staple in swedish cinema  even ingmar bergman  arguably their answer to good old boy john ford  had sex scenes in his films  br    br   i do commend the filmmakers for the fact that any sex shown in the film is shown for artistic purposes rather than just to shock people and make money to be shown in pornographic theaters in america  i am curious yellow is a good film for anyone wanting to study the meat and potatoes  no pun intended  of swedish cinema  but really  this film doesn t have much of a plot ',\n  ' i am curious  yellow  is a risible and pretentious steaming pile  it doesn t matter what one s political views are because this film can hardly be taken seriously on any level  as for the claim that frontal male nudity is an automatic nc 17  that isn t true  i ve seen r rated films with male nudity  granted  they only offer some fleeting views  but where are the r rated films with gaping vulvas and flapping labia  nowhere  because they don t exist  the same goes for those crappy cable shows  schlongs swinging in the breeze but not a clitoris in sight  and those pretentious indie movies like the brown bunny  in which we re treated to the site of vincent gallo s throbbing johnson  but not a trace of pink visible on chloe sevigny  before crying  or implying   double standard  in matters of nudity  the mentally obtuse should take into account one unavoidably obvious anatomical difference between men and women  there are no genitals on display when actresses appears nude  and the same cannot be said for a man  in fact  you generally won t see female genitals in an american film in anything short of porn or explicit erotica  this alleged double standard is less a double standard than an admittedly depressing ability to come to terms culturally with the insides of women s bodies ',\n  'if only to avoid making this type of film in the future  this film is interesting as an experiment but tells no cogent story  br    br   one might feel virtuous for sitting thru it because it touches on so many important issues but it does so without any discernable motive  the viewer comes away with no new perspectives  unless one comes up with one while one s mind wanders  as it will invariably do during

you to see that film instead  br    br   the film has two strong elements and those are   1  the realistic acting  2  the impressive  undeservedly good  photo  apart from that  what strikes me most is the endless stream of silliness  lena nyman has to be most annoying actress in the world  she acts so stupid and with all the nudity in this film    it s unattractive  comparing to godard s film  intellectuality has been replaced with stupidity  without going too far on this subject  i would say that follows from the difference in ideals between the french and the swedish society  br    br   a

who could resemble lucille ball  but they could at least find someone a bit similar in looks and talent  if you noticed york s portrayal of lucy in episodes of i love lucy like the chocolate factory

the country and western numbers are woefully mismatched with the standards on the soundtrack  surely this is not what gershwin  who wrote the song from which the movie s title is derived  had in mind  his stage musicals of the 20 s may have been slight  but at least they were long on charm   they all laughed  tries to coast on its good intentions  but nobody  least of all peter bogdanovich   has the good sense to put on the brakes  br    br   due in no small part to the tragic death of dorothy stratten  this movie has a special place in the heart of mr  bogdanovich  he even bought it back from its producers  then distributed it on his own and went bankrupt when it didn t prove popular  his rise and fall is among the more sympathetic and tragic of hollywood stories  so there s no joy in

film for peter bogdonavitch  he based it on his life but changed things around to fit the characters  who are detectives  these detectives date beautiful models and have no problem getting them  sounds more like a millionaire playboy filmmaker than a detective  doesn t it  this entire movie was written by peter  and it shows how out of touch with real people he was  you re supposed to write what you know  and he did that  indeed  and leaves the audience bored and confused  and jealous  for that matter  this is a curio for people who want to see dorothy stratten  who was murdered right after filming  but patti hanson  who would  in real life  marry keith richards  was also a model  like stratten  but is a lot better and has a more ample part  in fact  stratten s part seemed forced  added  she doesn t have a lot to do with the story  which is pretty convoluted to begin with  all in all  every character in this film is somebody that very few people can relate with  unless you re millionaire from manhattan with beautiful supermodels at your beckon call  for the rest of us  it s an irritating snore fest  that s what happens when you re out of touch  you entertain your few friends with inside jokes  and bore all the rest ',\n  'it was great to see some of my favorite stars of 30 years ago including john ritter  ben gazarra and audrey hepburn  they looked quite wonderful  but that was it  they were not given any characters or good lines to work with  i neither understood or cared what the characters were doing  br    br   some of the smaller female roles were fine  patty henson and colleen camp were quite competent and confident in their small sidekick parts  they showed some talent and it is sad they didn t go on to star in more and better films  sadly  i didn t think dorothy stratten got a chance to act in this her only important film role  br    br   the film appears to have some fans  and i was very open minded when i started watching it  i am a big peter bogdanovich fan and i enjoyed his last movie   cat s meow  and all his early ones from  targets  to  nickleodeon   so  it really surprised me that i was barely able to keep awake watching this one  br    br   it is ironic that this movie is about a detective agency where the detectives and clients get romantically involved with each other  five years later  bogdanovich s ex girlfriend  cybil shepherd had a hit television series called  moonlighting  stealing the story idea from bogdanovich  of course  there was a great difference in that the series relied on tons of witty dialogue  while this tries to make do with slapstick and a few screwball lines  br    br   bottom line  it ain t no  paper moon  and only a very pale version of  what s up  doc  ',\n  'i can t believe that those praising this movie herein aren t thinking of some other film  i was prepared for the possibility that this would be awful  but the script  or lack thereof  makes for a film that s also pointless  on the plus side  the general level of craft on the part of the actors and technical crew is quite competent  but when you ve got a sow s ear to work with you can t make a silk purse  ben g fans should stick with just about any other movie he s been in  dorothy s fans should stick to galaxina  peter b fans should stick to last picture show and target  fans of cheap laughs at the expense

the brouhaha surrounding ms  stratten s tawdry death  i think the real reason was because it was so bad ',\n  'its not the cast  a finer group of actors  you could not find  its not the setting  the director is in love with new york city  and by the end of the film  so are we all  woody allen could not improve upon what bogdonovich has done here  if you are going to fall in love  or find love  manhattan is the place to go  no  the problem with the movie is the script  there is none  the actors fall in love at first sight  words are unnecessary  in the director s own experience in hollywood that is what happens when they go to work on the set  it is reality to him  and his peers  but it is a fantasy to most of us in the real world  so  in the end  the movie is hollow  and shallow  and message less ',\n  'today i found  they all laughed  on vhs on sale in a rental  it was a really old and very used vhs  i had no information about this movie  but i liked the references listed on its cover  the names of peter bogdanovich  audrey hepburn  john ritter and specially dorothy stratten attracted me  the price was very low and i decided to risk and buy it  i searched imdb  and the user rating of 6 0 was an excellent reference  i looked in  mick martin   marsha porter video   dvd guide 2003  and \\x96 wow \\x96 four stars  so  i decided that i could not waste more time and immediately see it  indeed  i have just finished watching  they all laughed  and i found it a very boring overrated movie  the characters are badly developed  and i spent lots of minutes to understand their roles in the story  the plot is supposed to be funny  private eyes who fall in love for the women they are chasing   but i have not laughed along the whole story  the coincidences  in a huge city like new york  are ridiculous  ben gazarra as an attractive and very seductive man  with the women falling for him as if her were a brad pitt  antonio banderas or george clooney  is quite ridiculous  in the end  the greater attractions certainly are the presence of the playboy centerfold and playmate of the year dorothy stratten  murdered by her husband pretty after the release of this movie  and whose life was showed in  star 80  and  death of a centerfold  the dorothy stratten story   the amazing beauty of the sexy patti hansen  the future mrs  keith richards  the always wonderful  even being fifty two years old  audrey hepburn  and the song  amigo   from roberto carlos  although i do not like him  roberto carlos has been the most popular brazilian singer since the end of the 60 s and is called by his fans as  the king   i will keep this movie in my collection only because of these attractions  manly dorothy stratten   my vote is four  br    br   title  brazil    muito riso e muita alegria    many laughs and lots of happiness  ',\n  'this film is just plain horrible  john ritter doing pratt falls  75  of the actors delivering their lines as if they were reading them from cue cards  poor editing  horrible sound mixing  dialogue is tough to pick up in places over the background noise   and a plot that really goes nowhere  i didn t think i d ever say this  but dorothy stratten is not the worst actress in this film  there are at least 3 others that suck more  patti hansen delivers her lines with the passion of ben stein  i started to wonder if she wasn t dead inside  even bogdanovich s kids are awful  the oldest one is definitely reading her lines from a cue card   this movie is seriously horrible  there s a reason bogdanovich couldn t get another project until 4 years later  please don t watch it  if you see it in your television listings  cancel your cable  if a friend suggests it to you  reconsider your friendship  if your spouse wants to watch it  you re better off finding another soulmate  i d rather gouge my eyes out with lawn darts than sit through this piece of garbage again  if i could sum this film up in one word  that word would be  suckotrocity',\n  'my interest in dorothy stratten caused me to purchase this video  although it had great actors actresses  there were just too many subplots going on to retain interest  plus it just wasn t that interesting  dialogue was stiff and confusing and the story just flipped around too much to be believable  i was pretty disappointed in what i believe was one of audrey hepburn s last movies  i ll always love john ritter best in slapstick  he was just too pathetic here ',\n  'i have this film out of the library right now and i haven t finished watching it  it is so bad i am in disbelief  audrey hepburn had totally lost her talent by then  although she d pretty much finished with it in  robin and marian   this is the worst thing about this appallingly stupid film  it s really only of interest because it was her last feature film and because of the dorothy stratten appearance just prior to her homicide  br    br   there is nothing but idiocy between gazzara and his cronies  little signals and little bows and nods to real screwball comedy of which this is the faintest  palest shadow  br    br   who could believe that there are even some of the same manhattan environs that hepburn inhabited so magically and even mythically in  breakfast at tiffany s  twenty years earlier  the soundtrack of old sinatra songs and the gershwin song from which the title is taken is too loud and obvious  you sure don t have to wait for the credits to find out that something was subtly woven into the cine musique of the picture to know when the songs blasted out at you  br    br    reverting to type  means going back up as well as going back down  i guess  in this case  audrey hepburn s chic european lady is all you see of someone who was formerly occasionally an actress and always a star  here she has even lost her talent as a star  if someone whose talent was continuing to grow in the period  like ann margret  had played the role  there would have been some life in it  even given the unbelievably bad material and mongoloid level situations  br    br   hepburn was a great person  of course  greater than most movie stars ever dreamed of being  and she was once one of the most charming and beautiful of film actors  after this dreadful performance  she went on to make an atrocious tv movie with robert wagner called  love among thieves   in  they all laughed  it is as though she were still playing an ingenue in her 50 s  even much vainer and obviously less intelligent actresses who insisted upon doing this like lana turner were infinitely more effective than is hepburn  turner took acting seriously even when she was bad  hepburn doesn t take it seriously at all  couldn t be bothered with it  even her hair and clothes look tacky  her last really good work was in  two for the road   perhaps her most perfect  if possibly not her best in many ways  br    br   and that girl who plays the country singer is just sickening  john ritter is horrible  there is simply nothing to recommend this film except to see dorothy stratten  who was truly pretty  otherwise  critic david thomson s oft used phrase  losing his her talent  never has made more sense  br    br   ben gazarra had lost all sex appeal by then  and so we have 2 films with gazarra and hepburn  who could ask for anything less  sandra dee s last  pitiful film  lost   from 2 years later  a low budget nothing  had more to it than this  at least ms  dee spoke in her own voice  by 1981  audrey hepburn s accent just sounded silly  she d go on to do the pbs  gardens of the world with audrey hepburn  and there her somewhat irritating accent works as she walks through english gardens with aristocrats or waxes effusively about  what i like most is when flowers go back to nature   as in naturalized daffodils  but in an actual fictional movie  she just sounds ridiculous  br    br   to think that  breakfast at tiffany s  was such a profound sort of light poetic thing with audrey hepburn one of the most beautiful women in the world  she was surely one of the most beautiful screen presences in  my fair lady   matching garbo in several things and delphine seyrig in  last year at marienbad   and then this  and her final brief role as the angel  hap  in the spielberg film  always  was just more of the lady stuff  corny  witless and stifling  br    br   i went to her memorial service at the fifth avenue presbyterian church  a beautiful service which included a boys  choir singing the shaker hymn  simple gifts   the only thing not listed in the program was the sudden playing of hepburn s singing  moon river  on the fire escape in  breakfast at tiffany s   and this brought much emotion and some real tears out in the congregation  br    br   a great lady who was once a fine actress  as in  the nun s story   and one of the greatest and most beautiful of film stars in many movies of the 50 s and 60 s who became a truly bad one  that s not all that common  and perhaps it is only a great human being who  in making such things as film performances trivial  nevertheless has the largeness of mind to want to have the flaws pointed out mercilessly  which all of her late film work contained in abundance  most of the talk about hepburn s miscasting is about  my fair lady   but the one that should have had the original actress in it was  wait until dark   which had starred lee remick on broadway  never as celebrated as hepburn  she was a better actress in many ways  hepburn was completely incapable of playing anything really sordid   although hepburn was at least adequate enough in that part  after that  all of her acting went downhill ',\n  'i think i will make a movie next weekend  oh wait  i m working  oh i m sure i can fit it in  it looks like

flesh eating was just thrown in as an extra  we re actually bored throughout most of this 3 part chronicle because of the lame twilight zone like  easily understood and slow pacingly revealed finale s

' spoilers  br    br   i was very disappointed in love s abiding joy  i had been waiting a really long time to see it and i finally got the chance when it re aired thursday night on hallmark  i love the first three  love  movies but this one was nothing like i thought it was going to be  the whole movie was sad and depressing  there were way to many goofs  and the editing was very poor   to many scenes out of context  i also think the death of baby kathy happened way to soon and clarks appearance in the movie just didn t seem to fit  it seemed like none of the actors really wanted to be there   they were all lacking emotion  there seemed to be no interaction between missie and willie at all  br    br   i think the script writers should have went more by the book  it seems like every movie that s been made so far just slips further and further away from janette oke s writings  i mean in the movie they never mentioned a thing about the mine and the two boys or clark getting hurt because of it  and i think missie and willies reactions to kathy s death could have been shown and heard rather than just heard  br    br   out of the four movies that have been made so far i d have to say that love s abiding joy is my least favorite  i hope with the next four movies that more of the book is followed and if clarks character is in them i hope he s got a bigger part and i hope his part isn t so bland  i also hope there is more of scottie and cookie and maybe even marty but who knows what the script writers will have in store next ',\n  'i ve seen all four of the movies in this series  each one strays further and further from the books  this is the worst one yet  my problem is that it does not follow the book it is titled after in any way  the directors and producers should have named it any thing other than  love s abiding joy   the only thing about this movie that remotely resembles the book are the names of some of the characters  willie  missie  henry  clark  scottie and cookie   the names ages genders of the children are wrong  the entire story line is no where in the book  br    br   i find it a great disservice to janette oke  her books and her fans to produce a movie under her title that is not correct in any way  the music is too loud  the actors are not convincing   they lack emotions  br    br   if you want a good family movie  this might do  it is clean  don t watch it  though  if you are hoping for a condensed version of the book  i hope that this will be the last movie from this series  but i doubt it  if there are more movies made  i wish michael landon  jr and others would stick closer to the original plot and story lines  the books are excellent and  if closely followed  would make excellent movies ',\n  'i very much looked forward to this movie  its a good family movie  however  if michael landon jr  s editing team did a better job of editing  the movie would be much better  too many scenes out of context  i do hope there is another movie from the series  they re all very good  but  if another one is made  i beg them to take better care at editing  this story was all over the place and didn t seem to have a center  which is unfortunate because the other movies of the series were great  i enjoy the story of willie and missy  they re both great role models  plus  the romantic side of the viewers always enjoy a good love story ',\n  'i have read all of the love come softly books  knowing full well that movies can not use all aspects of the book but generally they at least have the main point of the book  i was highly disappointed in this movie  the only thing that they have in this movie that is in the book is that missy s father comes to visit  although in the book both parents come   that is all  the story line was so twisted and far fetch and yes  sad  from the book  that i just couldn t enjoy it  even if i didn t read the book it was too sad  i do know that pioneer life was rough but the whole movie was a downer  the rating is for having the same family orientation of the film that makes them great ',\n  'as a southern baptist  it pains me that i must give a below average rating to an overtly christian movie  there certainly aren t so many that i want to discourage film makers from a genre that s woefully under exploited  still  i must honestly say that  love s abiding joy  is a typically low budget  low key  self consciously christian film  the plot is predictable  the acting mediocre  i m being kind   and the editing atrocious  as a tv movie it might have been slightly above average  but as a feature film it leaves much to be desired  keep trying guys  you ve got to have a movie about about real christians inside you somewhere  might i suggest you turn to g  k  chesterton or c  s  lewis

whether or not the actors and actresses knew exactly what they were getting into  did they see the script and say   hey  close encounters of the third kind was such a hit that this one can t fail   unfortunately  it does  did they even think to check on the director s credentials  i mean  would you do a movie with the director of a movie called  satan s cheerleaders   greydon clark  who would later go on to direct the infamous  final justice   made this  it makes you wonder how the people of mystery science theater 3000 could hammer  final justice  and completely miss out on  the return   br    br   the film is set in a small town in new mexico  a little boy and girl are in the street unsupervised one night when a powerful flashlight beam er a spaceship appears and hovers over them  in probably the worst special effect sequence of the film  the ship spews some kind of red ink on them  it looked like clark had held a beaker of water in from of the camera lens and dipped his leaky pen in it  so right away you are treated with cheese  anyhow  the ship leaves and the adults don t believe the children  elsewhere  we see vincent schiavelli  whom i find to be a terrific actor  watch his scenes in  ghost  for proof  as they are outstanding   who is playing a prospector  or as i called him  the miner 1949er  he steps out of the cave he is in  and he and his dog are inked by the ship  twenty five years go by  and the girl has grown up to be cybill shepherd  who works with her father  raymond burr  in studying unusual weather phenomena  or something like that  shepherd spots some strange phenomena in satellite pictures over that little new mexico town  and she travels there to research it  once she gets there  the local ranchers harass her  and blame her for the recent slew of cattle mutilations that have been going on  and deputy jan michael vincent comes to her rescue  from this point on  the film really drags as the two quickly fall for each other  especially after vincent wards off the locals and informs shepherd that he was the little boy that saw the ship with her twenty five years earlier  while this boring mess is happening  vincent schiavelli  with his killer dog at his side  is walking around killing the cattle and any people he runs into with an unusual item  you know those glowing plastic sticks stores sell for trick or treaters at halloween  the kind that you shake to make them glow  schiavelli uses what looks like one of those glow sticks to burn incisions in people  it s the second worst effect in the movie  every time schiavelli is on screen with the glow stick  the scene s atmosphere suddenly turns dark  like the filmmakers thought the glow stick needed that enhancement  it ends up making the movie look even cheaper than it is  br    br   and what does all this lead up to  it s hard to tell when the final  confusing scene arrives  see  burr and his team of scientists try to explain the satellite images that shepherd found as some kind of  calling card   but none of it makes sense  why do shepherd and vincent age and schiavelli does not  schiavelli explains why he is killing cattle and people and why he wants shepherd dead  but even that doesn t make much sense when you really think about it  i mean  why doesn t he kill jan michael vincent  after all  he had twenty five years to do it  and the aliens won t need him if shepherd is dead anyhow  so why try to kill her  speaking of the aliens  it is never clear what they really wanted out of shepherd and vincent  what is their goal  why do they wait so long to intervene  how could they be so sure shepherd would come back  not that the answer to any of these and other questions would have made  the return  any more pleasant  you would still have bad lines  really bad acting  particularly by shepherd  cheesy effects  and poor direction  luckily  the stars escaped from this movie  cybill shepherd soon went on to star in  moonlighting  with bruce willis  jan michael vincent went on to be featured in dozens of b movies  often in over the top parts  raymond burr made a pile of perry mason television movies right up until his death  vincent schiavelli went on to be a great character actor in a huge number of films  martin landau  who played a kooky law enforcement officer  quickly made the terrific  alone in the dark  and the awful  the being  before rolling into the films he has been famous for recently  you can bet none of these stars ever want their careers to return to  the return   zantara s score  2 out of 10 ',\n  'as a kid i did think the weapon the murderer wielded was cool  however i was a kid and so i was a bit dumb  even as a dumb kid though the movies plot was stupid and a bit boring when the killer was not using his light knife to kill people  what amazes me is that the movie has a really solid cast in it  what script did they read when agreeing to be in this movie as it is most assuredly boring and only a means to show off a light saber on a very small scale  the plot at times is incomprehensible and the end is totally chaotic  the whole film seems to rotate around aliens and the one weapon  the plot has two kids and some dude having an alien encounter  flash years later and there seems to be a return as it were in the mix  dead animals and such to be explored and for some reason the one dude gets the weapon of the aliens and proceeds to use it to go on a very light killing spree  seriously  you just have to wonder why this movie was made  if you are going to have a killer have some good death

storyline on a plot about the jarrow march was feeble but the 50s version had students who were beginning to think about the world around them so i suppose making them think about the poverty of the marchers is much the same thing  all the stuff about japp having to cater for himself was weak too but they had to put something in to fill the time  this would have made a decent half hour show or

plus points  the support acting from edgerton in particular  assured direction from jordan  confirming his talent on show in buffalo soldiers as well   and production design that gave a real feel of harshness to the australian bush  much as the irish immigrants of the early 19th century must have seen it  but i can t help feeling that another opportunity has been missed to tell the real story of

rate  alarming because never has a film plodded so slowly   the feeling of numbness after the two hours of pure drivel brought back memories of costner s awful wyatt earp all those years ago  simply put  nothing happens in the film  but it takes a long time getting to that nothing  this would possibly have been a tad more bearable if the performances were good  because the direction sure as heck wasn t   however  unless you are looking to play a game of spot the worst oirish accent  then you re gonna be disappointed  between that  the game of  who has the stupidest beard     spot the obvious backstabber    clue  they are all ginger for some reason   and  nature in australia including lions   it is an experience similar to flicking through hallmark  the history channel  discovery channel  and neighbours whilst suffering a huge hangover  yup  nature pops up a lot  as to fill even more time  possibly an attempt to look arty   the film keeps showing pointless wildlife shots  and once all the native species are shown  here s a circus to allow for a camel and a lion  which is used during one fight to try to make us actually feel more sorry for the lion than the massacred people   br    br   this is a turgid  emotionless piece of historical fluff which should have gone straight to tv  there isn t even one good word i can say about this film  even the usually fantastic rush seems embarrassed to be here  when one of the characters comments that there is only 2 bullets left for him and his pal  i myself was wishing i had a gun to blow any memory of this film out of my head ',\n  'they constructed this one as a kind of fantasy man from snowy river meets butch cassidy and the sundance kid  and just for a romantic touch ned and joe get to play away with high class talent  the bored young wives of wealthy older men  ok  there are lots of myths about ned kelly  but there are also a lot of well documented facts  still leaving space for artistic creativity in producing a good historical dramaticisation  i mean  this is not the robin hood story  not the arthurian legends  not beowulf  not someone whose life is so shrouded in the mists of many many centuries past that any recreation of their life and times is 99  guesswork  it s only a couple of lifetimes ago  my own grandparents were already of school age when ned was hanged   br    br   so it s silly me for fancifully imagining this movie was a serious attempt to tell the kelly story  having recently read peter carey s excellent novel  the true history of the kelly gang  i had eagerly anticipated that this would be in similar vein  but no  the fact is that mick jagger s much derided 1970 kelly was probably far closer to reality  and a better movie overall  which isn t saying a whole lot for it  br    br   glad it only cost me two bucks to hire the dvd  i ll give it 3 10  and that s only because some of the nice shots of the australian bush make me feel generous ',\n  'this has to be the worst piece of garbage i ve seen in a while  br    br   heath ledger is a heartthrob  he looked deformed  i wish i d known that he and naomi watts are an item in real life because i spent 2 of the longest hours of my life wondering what she saw in him   br    br   orlando bloom is a heartthrob  with the scraggly beard and deer in the headlights look about him  i can t say i agree  br    br   rachel griffiths was her usual fabulous self  but geoffrey rush looked as if he couldn t wait to get off the set   br    br   i m supposed to feel sorry for bankrobbers and murderers  this is a far cry from butch cassidy  which actually was an entertaining film  this was trite  cliche ridden and boring  we only stayed because we were convinced it would get better  it didn t  br    br   the last 10 15 minutes or so were unintentionally hilarious  heath and his gang are holed up in a frontier hotel  and women and children are dying because of their presence  that s not funny  but it was funny when they walked out of the hotel with the armor on  because all we could think of was the black knight from monty python and the holy grail  i kept waiting for them to say  i ll bite yer leg off   we were howling with laughter  as were several other warped members of the audience  when we left  pretty much everyone was talking about what a waste of time this film was  br    br   i may not have paid cash to see this disaster  sneak preview   but it certainly wasn t free  it cost me 2 hours of my life that i will never get back ',\n  'if the term itself were not geographically and semantically meaningless  one might well refer to  ned kelly  as an  australian western   for the people down under  ned kelly was  apparently  a folk hero bandit akin to robin hood  jesse james  bonnie and clyde  and butch cassidy and the sundance kid  the descendant of irish immigrants  kelly became a fugitive and an outlaw after he was falsely accused of shooting an australian law officer  a crime for which his equally innocent mother was put into prison  to get back at the government for this mistreatment  kelly  his brother dan  and two other companions  became notorious bank robbers  winning over the hearts of many people in the countryside while striking a blow for justice in a land where irish immigrants were often treated with disrespect and disdain by those who ran the country  br    br   perhaps because we ve encountered this  gentleman bandit  scenario so many times in the past   ned kelly  feels awfully familiar and unoriginal as it pays homage to any number of the genre s stereotypes and clichés on its way to the inevitable showdown  ned is the typical heart of gold lawbreaker who kills only when he is forced to and  even then  only with the deepest regret  he also has the pulse of the common folk  as when  in the middle of a bank robbery  he returns a valuable watch to one of the customers  after one of his gang has so inconsiderately pilfered it  what movie on this particular subject hasn t featured a scene like that  it s acts of selective generosity like this  of course  that earn him the love and respect of all the little people who come to secretly admire anyone who can get away with sticking it to the powers that be and the status quo  geoffrey rush plays the typical bedeviled law enforcer who feels a personal stake in bringing down this upstart troublemaker who keeps getting away with tweaking the establishment  there s even the inevitable episode in which one of the ladies being held up goes into the next room and has sex with one of the robbers  so turned on is she by the romantic derring do of the criminal lifestyle  and the film is riddled with one hackneyed scene like this after another  br    br   heath ledger fails to distinguish himself in the title role  providing little in the way of substance to make his character either interesting or engaging  it doesn t help that he has been forced to provide a droning voice over narration that underlines the sanctimoniousness and pretentiousness of both the character and the film  br    br    ned kelly  might serve a function of sorts as a lesson in australian history  but as an entertainment  it s just the same old story told with different accents ',\n  'this movie was so unrelentingly bad  i could hardly believe i was watching it  the directing  editing  production  and script all seemed as though they had been done by junior high school students who don t know all that much about movies  there was no narrative flow that made any sort of sense  big emotional moments and climaxes  like one early on between heath ledger and naomi watts  and character relationships  like one hinted at at the very beginning  come completely out of no where and are not set up like they would have been in a more elegantly and effectively made film  the characters are sadly underdeveloped  making it difficult for us to have any sort of connection with them  the acting  surprisingly  is not entirely bad  but the terrible writing cancels out the relatively convincing performances  the film plays like a particularly bad t v  western epic  and sadly diminishes the fascinating  true  story that it attempts to tell  i have read a lot of reviews that defend the film as being important to australians because of the subject matter  that s all very well  but just because ned kelly is an important australian historical icon doesn t make the movie good  no one is saying that the subject matter isn t good  just the quality of the movie itself  pearl harbor was about a very important historical event to americans  but that doesn t mean i m going to defend the movie and say it was good  because it was still bad  a failure all around  though heath and orlando are lovely to look at ',\n  'this movie never made it to theaters in our area  so when it became available on dvd i was one of the first to rent it  for once  i should listened to the critics and passed on this one  br    br   despite the excellent line up of actors the movie was very disappointing  i can see now why it went straight to video   br    br   i had thought that with bloom  ledger  and rush it could have some value  all have done wonderful work in the past   br    br   the movie was slow moving and never pulled me in  i failed to develop much empathy for the characters and had to fight the urge to fast forward just to get to the end   br    br   i do not recommend this film even if you are thinking of renting it for only for  eye candy  purposes  it won t satisfy even that ',\n  'i thought this was a very clunky  uninvolving version of a famous australian story  heath ledger and orlando bloom were very good in their roles  and gave their characters some personality  but the whole thing felt forced and mechanical  br    br   the beginning could have been a lot more involving  perhaps starting with a shootout  and then flashing back for a recap of how they got there or that sort of thing  and i felt like every scene was routinely predictable and signposted  like a very bad tv soap  br    br   i was really looking forward to this movie  and hoping for something a lot better  the only thing i can say in its favour is that it beats the mick jagger version  but not by much ',\n  'ned akelly is such an important story to australians but this movie is awful  it s an australian story yet it seems like it was set in america  also ned was an australian yet he has an irish accent   it is the worst film i have seen in a long time',\n  'from the very beginning  the political theme of this film is so obvious and heavy handed  that the outcome is entirely predictable  any good textbook on writing screenplays will advise layering of characters  incorporating character arcs  and three act structure  in this film you will find none of that  the police are the baddies  and consequently are shown as shallow  incompetent and cowards  it never seems to occur to the makers of this film that police might be honourable citizens who see joining the police as a good way to contribute to the wellbeing of society  br    br   the viewer gets no opportunity to make up his or her mind on whether ned kelly is a good guy or a ruthless villain  the film opens with him being arrested for stealing a horse  but we get no clue as to his guilt or innocence  we see him walk through the door of a gaol  but only know that he has been inside for three years when we hear this much later in some dialogue  br    br   this film contains many shots of ned looking at the camera with a serious expression  i found the film a real chore to watch  it is the direction for modern films  and this one put me off watching any more ',\n  'i guess i was attracted to this film both because of the sound of the story and the leading actor  so i gave it a chance  from director gregor jordan  buffalo soldiers   basically ned kelly  heath ledger  is set up by the police  especially superintendent francis hare  geoffrey rush   he is forced to go on the run forming a gang and go against them to clear his own and his family s names  that s really all i can say about the story  as i wasn t paying the fullest attention to be honest  also starring orlando bloom as joseph byrne  naomi watts as julia cook  laurence kinlan as dan kelly  philip barantini as steve hart  joel edgerton as aaron sherritt  kiri paramore as constable fitzpatrick  kerry condon as kate kelly  emily browning as grace kelly and rachel griffiths as susan scott  ledger makes a pretty good performance  for what it s worth  and the film does have it s eye catching moments  particularly with a gun battle towards the end  but i can t say i enjoyed it as i didn t look at it all  okay ',\n  'i don t quite get the rating for the amati girls and i think i was really kind giving it a 4 out of 10  what could otherwise have been a wonderful story with actually a set of more or less decent actors became a total farce in my eyes  there are so many clichés in that flick  the women s hair is just awful and most of the scenes are more than unrealistic or seem fake  there s no real passion in this movie but a bunch of actors over acting over any limits that it hurts  it s not funny enough to be a comedy  it s too fake sad to really touch  so in my eyes it s just not good  watching it i couldn t believe how something like that made it to my tv set in my living room in switzerland  but   maybe it still was ok and it just got lost in translation  who knows  definitely one of the oddest movies i ve ever seen and this certainly not in a good way  sorry ',\n  'this movie was awful  the ending was absolutely horrible  there was no plot to the movie whatsoever  the only thing that was decent about the movie was the acting done by robert duvall and james earl jones  their performances were excellent  the only problem was that the movie did not do their acting performances any justice  if the script would have come close to capturing a halfway decent story  it would be worth watching  instead  robert duvall s and james earl jones  performances are completely wasted on a god awful storyline   or lack thereof  not only was i left waiting throughout the movie for something to happen to make the movie    well an actual movie   not just utterless dialog between characters for what ended up being absolutely no reason  it was nothing more than common dialog that would have taken place back in that period of time  there was nothing special about any of the characters  the only thing special was how robert duvall portrayed a rambling  senile  drunk  old man  nothing worthy happens during the entire movie including the end  when the movie ended  i sat amazed   amazed that i sat through the entire movie waiting for something of interest to happen to make watching the movie worth while  it never happened  the cast of characters suddenly started rolling making it apparent that the movie really was over and i realized that i had just wasted 2 hours of my life watching a movie with absolutely no plot and no meaning  it wasn t even a story  the entire movie takes place in a day s worth of time  that s it  it was one day in the life  and death  of some southerners on a plantation  how much of a story can take place in a single day  other than the movie training day   the acting performances by the entire cast were excellent  but they were grossly wasted on such a disappointment of a movie   if you can even call it a movie ',\n  'holy crap  this was the worst film i have seen in a long time  all the performances are fine  but there is no plot  really  no plot  a bunch of clowns talk about this and that and that s your film  ug    robert duvall s character is senile and keeps asking the same people the same qestions over and over  this earns him the same responses over and over  i am pretty sure this film got upto a six because people think they should like it  good performances with famous and well regarded actors  but the actual complete work is a steamy turd  well  maybe that s a bit deceptive since steam rising from a fresh pile sounds a little like something happening and in this film nothing happens  sack',\n  'swing  is an important film because it s one of the remaining black produced and acted films from the 1930s  many of these films have simply deteriorated so badly that they are unwatchable  but this one is in fairly good shape  it s also a nice chance to see many of the talented black performers of the period just after the heyday of the old cotton club  a time all but forgotten today  br    br   unfortunately  while the film is historically important and has some lovely performances  it s also a mess  the main plot is very similar to the hollywood musicals of the era  including a prima donna who is going to ruin the show and the surprise unknown who appears from no where to save the day  however  the writing is just god awful and a bit trashy at times  and projects images of black america that some might find a bit demeaning  this is because before the plot really gets going  you are treated to a no account bum who lives off his hard working wife  a popular stereotype of the time  and when he is caught with a hussy  who  by the way  totally overplays this role   they have a fight which looks like a scene from wwe smackdown  and  the one lady wants to cut the other lady with a straight razor  a trashy scene indeed  later in the film  when the prima donna is behaving abominably  her husband punches her in the face and everyone applauds him  it seems like the film  at times  wants to appeal to the lowest common denominator in the audience plus they can t even do this well  with some of the worst acting i ve seen in a very long time  br    br   still  if you can look past a lousy production in just about every way  with trashy characters  bad acting and direction and poor writing   this one might be worth a peek so you can see excellent singing and tap dancing  as well as to catch a glimpse of forgotten black culture  just don t say i didn t warn you about the acting  it s really  really bad ',\n  'there s not a drop of sunshine in  the sunshine boys   which makes the title of this alleged comedy neil simon s sole ironic moment  simon  who adapted the script from his play  which goes uncredited   equates old age with irrational behavior  and  worse  clumsy  galumphing  mean spirited irrational behavior  walter matthau is merciless on us playing an aged vaudeville performer talked into reuniting with former comedy partner george burns for a television special  it s said they were a team for 43 years  which begs the question  how long did vaudeville last  anyway     burns  who won a supporting oscar  has the misfortune of coming to the film some thirty minutes in  after which time matthau has already blasted the material to hell and back  the noisier the movie gets  the less tolerable and watchable it is  director herbert ross only did solid work when he wasn t coupled with one of neil simon s screenplays  here  ross sets up gags like a thudding amateur  hammering away at belligerent routines which fail to pay off  such as semi incoherent matthau showing up at a mechanic s garage to audition for a tv commercial   at this point  matthau was still too young for this role  and he over compensates by slouching and hollering  it was up to ross and simon to tone down the character  to nuance his temperament to give  the sunshine boys  some sunniness  yet walter continues to project as if we d all gone deaf  the picture looks terribly drab and crawls along at a spiritless pace  one loses hope for it early on   1 2 from     ',\n  'i like goldie hawn and wanted another one of her films  so when i saw protocol for  5 50 at walmart i purchased it  although mildly amusing  the film never really hits it a stride  some scenes such as a party scene in a bar just goes on for too long and really has no purpose  br    br   then  of course  there is the preachy scene at the end of the film which gives the whole film a bad taste as far as i m concerned  i don t think this scene added to the movie at all  i don t like stupid comedies trying to teach me a lesson  written by some  60 s burn out especially  br    br   in the end  although i m glad to possess another hawn movie  i m not sure it was really worth the money i paid for it ',\n  'protocol is an implausible movie whose only saving grace is that it stars goldie hawn along with a good cast of supporting actors  the story revolves around a ditzy cocktail waitress who becomes famous after inadvertently saving the life of an arab dignitary  the story goes downhill halfway through the movie and goldie s charm just doesn t save this movie  unless you are a goldie hawn fan don t go out of your way to see this film ',\n  'when an attempt is made to assassinate the emir of ohtar  an arab potentate visiting washington  d c   his life is saved by a cocktail waitress named sunny davis  sunny becomes a national heroine and media celebrity and as a reward is offered a job working for the protocol section of the united states department of state  unknown to her however  the state department officials who offer her the job have a hidden agenda  br    br   a map we see shows ohtar lying on the borders of saudi arabia and south yemen  in an area of barren desert known as the rub al khali  or empty quarter  in real life a state in this location would have a population of virtually zero  and virtually zero strategic value  but for the purposes of the film we have to accept that ohtar is of immense strategic importance in the cold war and that the american government  who are keen to build a military base there  need to do all that they can in order to keep on the good side of its ruler  it transpires that the emir has taken a fancy to the attractive young woman who saved him and he has reached a deal with the state department  they can have their base provided that he can have sunny as the latest addition to his harem  sunny s new job is just a ruse to ensure that the emir has further opportunities to meet her  br    br   a plot like this could have been the occasion for some hilarious satire  but in fact the film s satirical content is rather toned down  possibly in 1984 the american public were not in the mood for trenchant satire on their country s foreign policy  this was  after all  the year in which ronald reagan carried forty nine out of fifty states in the presidential election and his hard line with the soviet union was clearly going down well with the voters   if the film had been made a couple of years later  in the wake of the iran contra affair  its tone might have been different   br    br   the film is not so much a satire as a vehicle for goldie hawn to show off her brand of cuteness and charm  sunny is a typical goldie character  pretty  sweet natured  naive and not too bright  there is  however  a limit to how far you can go with cuteness and charm alone  and you cannot automatically make a bad film a good one just by making the leading character a dumb blonde   actually  that sounds more like a recipe for making a good film a bad one   goldie tries her best to save this one  but never succeeds  part of the reason is the inconsistent way in which her character is portrayed  on the one hand sunny is a sweet  innocent country girl from oregon  on the other hand she is a 35 year old woman who works in a sleazy bar and wears a revealing costume  the effect is rather like imagining rebecca of sunnybrook farm grown up and working as a bunny girl  br    br   the more important reason why goldie is unable to rescue this film is even the best comedian or comedienne is no better than his her material  and  protocol  is simply unfunny  whatever humour exists is tired and strained  relying on offensive stereotypes about arab men who  apparently  all lust after western women  particularly if they are blonde and blue eyed  there was a lot of this sort of thing about in the mid eighties  as this was the period which also saw the awful ben kingsley  nastassia kinski film  harem   about a lascivious middle eastern ruler who kidnaps a young american woman  and the mini series of the same name which told a virtually identical story with a period setting  the film makers seem to have realised that their film would not work as a pure comedy  because towards the end it turns into a sort of latter day  mr smith goes to washington   sunny turns from a blonde bimbo into a fount of political wisdom and starts uttering all sorts of platitudes about democracy and the constitution and the citizen s duty to vote and we the people and how the price of liberty is eternal vigilance blah blah blah\\x85\\x85  but in truth the film is no more successful as a political parable than it is as a comedy  br    br   goldie hawn has made a number of good comedies  such as  cactus flower    overboard  and   housesitter   but  protocol  is not one of them  i have not seen all of her films  but of those i have seen this dire comedy is by far the worst  3 10',\n  'what does the   executive producer   do in a movie   if i remember correctly it s the person who raised the financial backing to make the movie   you might notice in a great number of movies starring sean connery that he is also the executive producer which meant connery himself raised the money since he is a major player   unfortunately it should also be pointed out that a great number of movies   starring sean connery were solely made because he managed to raise the money since he s a major hollywood player   it s usually an indication that when the credits read that the executive producer and the star of the movie are one and the same the movie itself is nothing more than a star vehicle with the story screenplay not being up to scratch  br    br   protocol follows the saga of one sunny davis a kooky bimboesque cocktail waitress who saves a visiting dignitary and as a reward gets made a top diplomat   likely   as things progress ms davis   who has problems being able to string two sentences together   finds herself in more outlandish and less likely situations   when i say that protocol stars goldie hawn who is also the film s executive producer do you understand what i m saying about the story screenplay not being up to scratch   exactly',\n  'outlandish premise that rates low on plausibility and unfortunately also struggles feebly to raise laughs or interest  only hawn s well known charm allows it to skate by on very thin ice  goldie s gotta be a contender for an actress who s done so much in her career with very little quality material at her disposal    br    br   ',\n  'there are only two movies i would give a 1 10 to  this stinker and  the man who fell to earth   i remember seeing protocol at a theater in the early 80s when i was in high school  the script is insulting to anyone  including a high school student s  intelligence  it completely lost me with the  hillarious  gag of someone getting shot in the butt  goldie hawn is supposed to be charming but comes across as vapid and moronic  then there are offensive stereotypes about arabs  followed by goldie winning over everyone by spouting populist dribble  the acting was terrible  including goldie hawn s  i could not stand to see another movie she was in until imo she redeemed herself in everyone says i love you  this is the kind of movie you make if you want to put no effort into screenplay writing  the worst ',\n  'the only good thing about this movie was the shot of goldie hawn standing in her little french cut bikini panties and struggling to keep a dozen other depraved women from removing her skimpy little cotton top while she giggled and cooed  ooooof  her loins rival those of nina hartley  this movie came out when i was fourteen and that shot nearly killed me  i d forgotten about it all tucked away in the naughty roladex of my mind until seeing it the other day on tv  where they actually blurred her midsection in that scene  good grief  reminding me what a smokin  hottie of a woman goldie hawn was in the  80s  kurt russell must have had a fun life ',\n  'i m studying catalan  and was delighted to find el mar  a movie with mostly catalan dialogue  at my art house video store  br    br   hmmm    not so delighted to have seen it  br    br   yes  as other reviewers have said  it s well made  and beautifully photographed  although the opening sequence of the children is shockingly violent  it s well acted and convincing   for the most part  that is    would the mallorquins strip a corpse in preparation for burial right

 mutilation   fanaticism   animal cruelty   betrayal    br    br   the opening sequence is not nearly enough to make the personalities and relationships of the characters believable  to work  this should have had multiple flashbacks to flesh out the characters  as it is  it seems a bizarre and depressing cross between  brother sun  sister moon  and  pulp fiction   if that sounds like something you ve got to see  by all means  enjoy  i think i go with something that doesn t make me feel i need to take a shower to wash off the gore and gloom  br    br   as for the catalan  it s the mallorqui dialect  fairly different than the barcelona dialect  though i was surprised by the comment that said that even barcelonans apparently needed catalan subtitles to understand it ',\n  'i was excited to view a cataluña´s film in the berlin´s competition  but after the presentation i was total disappointed and furious  too much blood  too much time  too much themes for nothing  the spanish civil war  like every war  was horrible  the revenge  a very human behavior  not pretty at all  is shown in uncountable films and plays  as well as the relations between homosexuals and the scepticism in spain about catholicism   but what mr villaronga try  is a pseudo tragedy that can belongs to the worst of the film´s history  it is really a pity to see angela molina in this movie  i advise nobody under no circumstances to go to see this film ',\n  'this film was a major letdown  the level of relentless cruelty and violence in this film was very disturbing  some scenes were truly unnecessarily ugly and mean spirited  the main characters were impossible to identify with or even sympathize with  the lead protagonist s character was as slimy as they come  the sickroom hothouse atmosphere lent itself to over the top theatrics  little or nothing could be learned about the spanish civil war from this film  fortunately  i ve been to spain and realize this is not realistic  in addition  the use of same sex attraction as a lurid  horror  was also very offensive and poorly handled  while the dvd is being packaged and advertised to attract gay viewers  the actors seemed uncomfortable in their roles as if they were trying to distance themselves from this mess i guess if you like watching children and pets being brutally killed this film might especially appeal to you ',\n  'three part  horror  film with some guy in a boarded up house imploring the viewer not to go  out there  and  unfortunately  gives us three tales to prove why  br    br   the first story involves a young couple in

be left a little lost  br    br   i had it as a xmas gift  as it s a family trait to work through the films of a actor we find talented  and matthew mconaughey was just awesome in  a time to kill    and the  the newton boys   so i expressed i wanted to see more of his work  br    br   however although it says on the dvd box it is a matthew mconaughey film and uses this as a marketing ploy  he has a few lines and is on screen for not very minutes at the end of the film  he is basically an extra and he doesn t exactly light up the screen while he is on  so die hard fans  really not worth it from that point of view  br    br   the films star though  patrick mcgaw is great though and very easy on the eye  and his character is just so nice and kind and caring  a true saint of a guy  he d be well written into a rom com  br    br   so for true mcconaughey acting brilliance of the ones i ve seen  i d recommend   a time to kill     the newton boys    frailty    how to lose a guy in 10 days    edtv  and  amistad  and avoid too  larger than life  and  angels in the outfield  unless you feel like a kids film or have kids around as neither of these are indicative of his talent  but are quite amusing films for children  again mm is really nothing more that a supporting artist with just a few if any lines  br    br   as for scorpion springit s not a bad film but it also isn t screen stealing either ',\n  'when a man who doesn t have alzheimer s can t remember how many films he s made  he probably is the world s most prolific director after all  that man is jesus franco  the king of so called  eurotrash   his 1980 flick devil hunter is as rushed  opaque  stupid  lazy and exploitative in the truest sense of the word  the film s title is misleading  for starters  as any other franco film i ve seen  that makes it sound pretty awful  and it is    yet franco does have some kind of inimitable sensibility  a generous way with the baldly outrageous  with nudity and sleaze and violence  and even with his stupid cheap editing which tries to pave over the extreme haste with which all his films were made  the mix of all these elements causes you to ride his films out  even while you re mostly waiting for them to end because they re so very tedious  br    br   devil hunter is nigh on incomprehensible for the first half an hour  the kidnap by strangers of a white woman who seems to be a model or film star is intercut with a bunch of native action in south america  there s lots of naked writhing  dancing  and endless repeated zoom ins on an ugly totem pole  you need to get used to the repetitive zoom ins and the technique of cutting back to the same shot about three times in a row right away  as these are franco s main methods of extending a film out to feature length  br    br   the monster who looks like the totem pole is actually kind of scary  he has raw bug eyes and his presence is always signalled on the soundtrack by cacophonous groaning  apparently recorded in an echo chamber  early in the piece he chews on a native lady strapped to a tree  and it s hard to know what really happens here but i think he ate her stomach  or her genitals  sweet jesus    br    br   anyway  the adventure begins properly when a studly guy and his freaked out vietnam vet pal are sent to the island to recover the white girl from the kidnappers  the flakey guy has an accent which  as dubbed  is half brooklyn american  half english liverpudlian and all retarded  all of the dialogue and dubbing is ridiculous and laughable  making for another layer of the film which can somehow hold your interest  br    br   not too much really happens from here on in  and it happens pretty sluggishly  studded with the odd bit of outrage like a rape  the nebulous action is fleshed out  haha   by acres of 360 degree nudity from the natives and the two female leads  and even from the monster himself  that he walks around with his penis exposed makes wrestling him an unappetising prospect for the tough guy hero  but it s gotta be done at some point  and it s nice to note that the director will show anyone s genitals on camera  br    br   the best feature of devil hunter is the location filming  franco can be extremely cheap with the structural and story aspects of film making  but he doesn t muck around with sets  you get real islands  jungles  helicopters and mountains  all in widescreen  this is something that is really cool to experience in these days of crappy cgi sets and backdrops ad nauseam  br    br   ultimately  issues of recommendation where this film is concerned seem moot  if you re trying to see all the video nasties  you will have to watch this at some point  and you ll be made as restless as i was  if you like franco  you ll watch this anyway  if you fall into neither of the above categories  the odds are you ll never come across this film  copies of it aren t just lying around  and i could hardly recommend the seeking out of it  it s franco  lazy  crazy franco ',\n  'i have been looking for this film for ages because it is quite rare to find as it was one of the video nasties  i finally found it on dvd at the end of last year it

south america  they take her into the jungle laura is guarded by some ridiculous native who calls himself  the devil  she has to go though all unpleasant things until they are happy  maidens are chained up  the devil demonstrates eating flesh in a horrible manner  peter weston  is the devil hunter  who goes into the jungle to try and rescue her ',\n  'as the number of video nasties i ve yet to see dwindles  this little pile of garbage popped up on my  to rent  list when i saw it was available  br    br   the premise involves a fashion model or something being kidnapped and taken into the jungle to be held for ransom by a motley crew of idiots  some other goof gets hired to bring her back and is given a sack of money to use as a bargaining chip  though if he returns with the girl and all the money  he gets a significant cut  he s brought a helicopter and pilot with him and  wow  that pilot is one of the worst actors ever  granted  they are all totally terrible and the dubbing will make you cry blood  after stealing away into the jungle  we learn that nearby is a cannibal cult whose flesheating earthbound god wanders the woods like a human king kong looking for tribeswomen to ravage and devour  now  this fellow is just a naked guy with some of the worst makeup ever  ping pong balls for eyes and that s pretty much it  his growls and groans are an everpresent feature on the soundtrack  and i found myself muting much of those scenes  br    br   oh  did i forget to mention the almost constant nudity  this is probably the main reason this film was banned  though there is one specific scene  about one second long  where the god attacks a girl and pulls her guts out  but it s not a redeeming factor for gore fans  also  jess franco goes beyond the usual t and a and shows lengthy close ups of female genitals  and  sadly  male as well  so  if you want  fair  in terms of exploitation  you got it  br    br   i can t recommend this trash to anyone  it s not even the good bad movie  it s just atrociously padded trash that only a video nasty fan will probably view and even then  if you are making your way through the list  leave this for the very last  if you watch it

random island in the pacific  where exactly does this take place  seems to be a mystery  the cannibal tribe is conformed by a couple of black women some black men  and a man who looks like a young

really  br    br   now i m not a massive jess franco fan  in fact to date this is only the second film of his i have seen  but even i can tell that this really isn t one of his best efforts  the films drags along at a pretty slow pace without much at all happening  the whole thing could have been edited down quite easily into a 25 minute tv show  there are plenty of overly long shots of people walking through the jungle that could have just been lifted straight out  br    br   devil hunter is poorly lit  infact i don t think it was lit at all   badly dubbed  poorly acted and slow yet for some reason it didn t bore me  i think the main reason for this was some of the hilariously bad scenes in it  for example a scene where laura is walking in the street was obviously shot in a real street as crowds of people stop to stare straight at the camera as its shooting  another funny scene has one of the gang who has been killed  hung in a tree dripping blood as one of his friends stands directly under him screaming for what seems like minutes  then for no reason at all the man in the trees head just falls of and hits the guy under him  it has to be seen to be believed  then of course there is the actual devil  it is just some naked black guy who despite the fact he has massive eyes  he has very blurry vision  br    br   the film was hooked up in part of the video nasty scare in the 80 s here in the uk and was banned  now why it was i have no idea  there is very little gore at all and it s hardly a shocking film  minus the nudity i would have said that it could get away with a pg almost  the only thing i can think of is that it was never actually watched and was added to the original list because of word of mouth  br    br   there is not much reason to watch this film really unless you are a massive jess franco fan  there is plenty of nudity to keep you from falling asleep and also some scenes that are so bad you can have a good laugh at them but other wise i would say just pay for a ticket to south america and get lost in a jungle  it would probably be more fun  br    br   3 10',\n  'an actress making a movie in africa is kidnapped and taken into the jungle

on the dpp  video nasty  list  but it really needn t have been  many films on the list where there for god  and dpp  only known reasons  and while this isn t the tamest of the bunch  there isn t a lot here that warrants banning   which is a shame because i never would have sat through it where it not for the fact that it s on  the shopping list   the plot actually gives the film a decent base   or at least more of a decent base than most cannibal films   and it follows an actress who is kidnapped and dragged off into the amazon jungle  a hunter is then hired to find her  but along the way he has to brave the natives  lead by a man who calls himself  the devil   hence the title   the film basically just plods along for eighty five minutes and there really aren t many scenes of interest  it s a real shame that jess franco ended up making films like this because the man clearly has talent  as seen by films such as the diabolical dr z  venus in furs  faceless and she kills in ecstasy  but unfortunately his good films are just gems amongst heaps of crap and devil hunter is very much a part of the crap  i saw this film purely because i want to be able to say i ve seen everything on the dpp s list  just two more to go    and i m guessing that s why most other people who have seen it  saw it  but if you re not on the lookout for nasties  there really is no reason to bother with this

with heavy breathing and lots of reverb  eurotrash fans will be plenty entertained by the bad english dubbing  gratuitous female flesh and very silly makeup jobs on the monster and native extras  for

tension or excitement involved   the horror side of things don t improve as we get a big black guy with stupid looking over sized bloodshot eyes plus two tame cannibal scenes  as a horror film sexo cannibal fails   as an action adventure it has no more success  this is one to avoid  br    br   director franco shows his usual incompetence throughout  a decapitated head is achieved by an actor lying on the ground with large leaves placed around the bottom of his neck to try   give the impression it s not attached to anything  the cannibal scenes are poor  the action is lame   it has endless scenes of people randomly walking around the jungle getting from  a  to  b    not really doing anything when they get there either  it becomes incredibly dull   tedious to watch after about 10 minutes   don t forget this thing goes on for 94 minutes in it s uncut state  i also must mention the hilarious scene when al cliver is supposed to be climbing a cliff  this is achieved by franco turning his camera on it s side   having cliver crawl along the floor  just look at the way his coat hangs   the way he never grabs onto to anything as he just pulls himself along  the gore isn t that great   as far as euro cannibal films go this is very tame  there are some gross close ups of the cannibals mouth as it chews bits of meat  a man is impaled on spikes  there s some blood   a handful of intestines  there s a fair bit of nudity in sexo cannibal   an unpleasant rape scene  br    br   sexo cannibal must have had a low budget   i mean low  this is a shoddy poorly made film with awful special effects   rock bottom production values  the only decent thing about it is the jungle setting which at least looks authentic  the music sucks   sound effects become annoying as there is lots of heavy breathing whenever the cannibal is on screen  the acting sucks  the whole thing was obviously dubbed anyway but no one in this thing can act  br    br   sexo cannibal is a terrible film that commits the fatal mistake of being as boring as hell  the only good things i can say is that it has a certain sleazy atmosphere to it   those close ups of the cannibal chewing meat are pretty gross

there s this one scene i remember when the mafia ape guy explains to his minions what rhetorical questions are  it s atrocious  many fans hate on the series for including a female turtle  but that didn t bother me  so much so that i didn t even remember her until i read about the show recently  all in all  it s miserably forgettable  br    br   the only okay thing was the theme song  guilty pleasure  they call it    nananana ninja   ',\n  'sometime in 1998  saban had acquired the rights to produce a brand new ninja turtles live action series  naturally  being a fan of the tmnt back in the day  this obviously peaked my interest  so when i started watching the show    to say i was disappointed by the end result is an understatement  some time later  more like recently   i got a chance to revisit the series  br    br   first off  let s talk about some of the positives  they managed to re create the turtles  lair as it was last seen in the movies fairly well given the limited budget they threw in with this  there tends to be this darker atmosphere overall in terms of the sets and whatnot  and the turtle suits  while not the greatest piece of puppetry and whatnot  were functional and seemed pretty sturdy for most of the action stuff that would follow in the series  br    br   people tend to complain about getting rid of shredder quickly and replacing him with these original villains who could have easily been used in a power rangers show  but you can only have shredder get beat so many times before it gets boring and undermines his worth as a villain    and besides  most fans don t realize or don t remember or just plain ignore the fact that in the original comic  the shredder was offed in the very first issue  never mind the countless resurrections that would follow  so on a personal standpoint  i was sort of glad they got rid of shredder because then the anticipation would build to the point where they would eventually bring him back in a later episode  i find that shredder in small quantities work best because then his encounters with the turtles are all the more memorable  br    br   unfortunately  they end up replacing him with these original villains who  as stated  seemed more fit for a power rangers show than a ninja turtles show  and with these new magic wielding generics comes a new female magic wielding turtle  the infamous venus de milo  i ll be honest  i never got comfortable with her  i m not against the idea of a female turtle  i m just against the idea of one who uses magic and thus sticks out like a sore sight among a clan of ninja turtles who seem somewhat out of their domain  i almost get the impression that this could have easily been the venus de milo show dealing with her make believe enemies and the tmnt are just there to provide the star power  or whatever was left considering the timeframe this was released   fortunately  they all share the spotlight together  br    br   next mutation was canned after a season on the air and the creators were more than happy to ignore it  given time and maybe another season  i really believe this live iteration of the tmnt could have been something and might have gotten a chance at greatness  but while the idea was sound  the execution was flawed  although there are a couple good episodes in this series   as it stands  next mutation is one of those oddities in turtledom that is best left buried and forgotten ',\n  'this is the biggest insult to tmnt ever  fortunantely  officially venus does not exist in canon tmnt  there will never be a female turtle  this took away from the tragic tale of 4 male unique mutants who will never have a family of their own  once gone no more  the biggest mistake was crossing over power rangers to tmnt with a horrible episode  the turtle s voices were wrong and they all acted out of character  they could have done such a better job  better designs and animatronics and no venus   br    br   don t bother with this people   it s cringe worthy material  the lip flap was slow and unnatural looking  they totally disrespected shredder  the main baddie  some dragonlord dude was corny  the turtles looked corny with things hanging off their bodies  what s with the thing around raph s thigh  the silly looking sculpted plastrons    br    br   if they looked normal  acted in character and got rid of venus  got rid of the stupid kiddie cartoon sounds   and better writing it could have been good ',\n  'i did not like the idea of the female turtle at all since 1987 we knew the tmnt to be four brothers with their teacher splinter and their enemies and each one of the four brothers are named after the great artists name like leonardo   michelangleo  raphel and donatello so venus here doesn t have any meaning or playing any important part and i believe that the old tmnt series was much more better than that new one which contains venus as a female turtle will not add any action to the story we like the story of the tmnt we knew in 1987 to have new enemies in every part is a good point to have some action but to have a female turtle is a very weak point to have some action  we wish to see more new of tmnt series but just as the same characters we knew in 1987 without that female turtle ',\n  'i cannot stay indifferent to lars van trier s films  i consider  breaking the waves  nothing less than a masterpiece  i loved  dancer in the night   i admired the idea in  dogville  but the overall exercise looked to me too dry and too theatrical  less cinema   europa  which i see only now was a famous film at its time  succeeded in the us the relative success of an european film and got the oscar for the best foreign language movie  but did not survive well the time in my opinion  it is also a too much explicit and extrovert exercise in cinema art to my taste  br    br   the story has a level of ambiguity that cannot escape the viewer  treating the period that immediately followed the second world war not in the black and white colors of victors and vanquished  of executioners and victims but as rather ambiguous times when people of both sides were fighting for survival in the aftermath of a catastrophic event that change the lives of nations and individuals forever is still a source of disputes even today  more such was novel and courageous two decades ago  yet it is the means of expression that really do not appear fit to the task  br    br   the film seems to include a lot of quotes descending directly from the films of hitchcock  especially his early films set in the pre war europe  with brave british spies fighting evil german spies on trains crossing at high speed the continent at dark  the trains were a symbol of the world and its conflicts with all their intensity and dramatism  here the train also becomes the symbol of the first sparkles of the re birth of germany after war  of its might  of its obsession with order and regulation  of punctuality and civility  the characters that populate the train are far from being the classical spy stories good or bad guys  the principal character a young american of german origin coming to post war europe willing to be part of a process of help and reconciliation finds himself in an ambiguous world of destruction and corruption  with liberators looking more like oppressive occupiers  with the vanquished not resigned to their fate but rather willing to continue on the path of self destruction  with love doubtfully mixed with treason  br    br   it is yet this classical film treatment that betrays the director in this case  the actions of the characters  especially of leopold kessler played by jean marc barr seem confused  and lack credibility  the overall cinematography seems to be not hitchcock like but rather from a bad imitation of hitchcock in the late 30s  the usage of color over the black and white film used in the majority of the time in moments of emotional intensity is also too demonstrative  it is not that van trier does not master his artistic means  but he is too demonstrative  he seems to try too hard to show what a great filmmaker he is  he really is great  as he will show in some of his later films  but it will be left to the viewers to decide this alone ',\n  'this film is terrible  you don t really need to read this review further  if you are planning on

interesting that they found someone who speaks and looks like michael madsen  only to find out that it is actually him  a new low even for him   br    br   the plot is terrible  people who claim that it is original or good have probably never seen a decent movie before  even by the standard of hollywood action flicks  this is a terrible movie  br    br   don t watch it    go for a jog instead   at

waste of my time  i just wanted to warn others  avoid this movie  the acting sucks and the writing is just moronic  bad in every way  the only nice thing about the movie are deniz akkaya s breasts  even that was ruined though by a terrible and unneeded rape scene  the movie is a poorly contrived and totally unbelievable piece of garbage  br    br   ok now i am just going to rag on imdb for this stupid rule of 10 lines of text minimum  first i waste my time watching this offal  then feeling compelled to warn others i create an account with imdb only to discover that i have to write a friggen

re bored of good  well executed movies  that is  i saw this last night at afi dallas  and i left with 20 minutes remaining  simply because i didn t care anymore  about the plot  not about insulting the director   that is awkward   when you can spot a goof only 5 minutes into the movie  a shot out  shattered window before any shots are fired   and then the window breaks with the first shot   things are going to bad  let s just say this is only an indicator of things to come   unfortunately  br    br   i ll spare you all the details  but this is sub par in every manner  even the half assed

the source of all conflict and resolution in films  character needs a gun  gets a gun  can t do that because he has a gun  puts his gun down first  oh my god what are we going to do   he has a gun  he waves it around  acting more malicious than real human beings ever do  he pushes it in someone s face for 90 minutes  shouting questions  the hallmark of any conclusion will be the comforting sound of police sirens   br    br   it s a real challenge to make such a tired  hackneyed formula work again  a film has to be very clever and well executed  this one is neither  it has no life and no personality  and it will suck these components from you  it will make you feel worse about living in the time and space that you do  really  who needs that   so yes  i ll say it  i think this may well be the worst film i have ever seen  anyone who was involved in the making of this sub  mediocre soul killing trash should be publicly embarrassed for the disservice they ve done to us all ',\n  'i

is poor  the angles are all messed up  not in a good way   the lines seem as if they re being read out of toilet paper  and the damn music   it always comes up when it shouldn t and goes out for no apparent reason  and don t go for writer either  by the way  making movies isn t like serving on a coffeshop  it requires art and skill  things i really doubt you ll ever have  br    br   instead of

apparently  if your script and dialogs are terrible  even good actors cannot save the day  not to mention the amateur actors that flood this film  too many non native english speakers play parts of native english speakers  reading out lines from a script that should have been thrown away and not having been made into a movie  it s unbelievable how unbelievable all the lines in the movie sound  the music is awful and totally out of place  and the whole thing looks and sounds like a poor school play  br    br   i recommend you watch it just so you would appreciate other  better  movies  this is why i gave it a 3 instead of the 1 it deserves ',\n  'i saw this dvd in my friends house and thought that this was a turkish action movie with some hollywood not very big names in it  interested enough i decide to give it a shot later   it was a tough to bear experience believe me  then  after finally seeing the credits roll i tought  we turks really suck at hollywood style film making   this is an insult to the heist hostage movie genre    but then wait  i checked some names and no  they were not turkish names and no  this was not a turkish movie  on the contrary it was literally shot in america with an american director   crew  that made me thinking again   how on earth can you persuade names like micheal madsen  edward furlong or even arnold vosloo to take part in such a project  with money probably   that kept me thinking further   how can you raise such amount of money to offer them and a supposedly international cast  then all my meditation paid off and i came to find the answer by hiring the cheapest equipment and crew that you can find  and if you still have to difficulty in adjustin your budget then  by writing and directing the movie you are trying to produce or vice versa i don t have any information on that   so bottom line this is not a bad movie as everybody are so anxious to present as   it makes you think  in my case even meditate  and there are a lot of movies outthere that doesn t give even that affect   this one at least makes you think  it makes you wonder   it leaves you with disbelief   and then it makes you wonder again  ',\n  'what was with all the turkish actors  no offense but i thought it was all for nothing for all these actors  the film had no script to test any actors acting skill or ability  it demanded next to nothing i bought this film to see michael madsen  he is one of my favorite actors but this film was another failure for him  the script was so bad  their was just nothing to sink your teeth into and all the characters were two dimensional  madsen tried to act like a hard ass but the script and direction didn t even allow him to do enough with his character to make it more interesting or 3 dimensional  br    br   even the sound effects of the gunfight at the beginning of the film sounded like the noise of paint ball guns when they are fired in a skirmish  it was really weird and they didn t sound like real guns  a video game had better sound effects than this film  there was also a really annoying bloke at the beginning of the film who was a member of the robbery gang  he had this american whining voice like a girl shouting lines like  lets get the f  k out of here  and what are we going to do man   he sounded like a girl  as a positive it was funny to watch and it made me laugh too  for a few seconds  whoo hoo   dumb film  poor madsen  he will bounce back   ',\n  'this movie was terrible  at first i just read the plot summary and it looked ok  so i watched it  the acting was terrible  it was like the actor were almost camera shy  everything seemed fake  i feel bad for edward furlong  terminator 2 was my favorite a few years ago   i ve watched it at least 20 times     br    br   the plot was also crap  the writers were probably sleep deprived when they came up with the lines  br    br   on the plus side  it s the good kind of bad movie  the one you keep watching just to see how much worst could it will get  so that later you can tell other people how you couldn t believe how terrible the movie was  br    br   i think everybody should watch this  so that then we could appreciate better other  real  movies ',\n  'i am a big fan of arnold vosloo  finally seeing him as the star of a recent movie  not just a bit part  made me happy  br    br   unfortunately i took film appreciation in college and the only thing i can say that i didn t like was that the film was made in an abandoned part of town and there was no background traffic or lookie loos  br    br   i have to say that the acting leaves something to be desired  but arnold is an excellent actor  i have to chalk it up to lousy direction and the supporting cast leaves something to be desired  br    br   i love arnold vosloo  and he made the film viewable  otherwise  i would have written it off as another lousy film  br    br   i found the rape scene brutal and unnecessary  but the actors that got away at the end were pretty good  but the sound effects of the shoot out were pretty bad  there are some glitches in the film  continuity  but they are overlookable considering the low caliber of the film  br

1969 and imdb says 1972   regardless of the exact date  the film definitely appears to be very indicative of this general time period  with some camera work and pop art stylings that are pure late 60s early 70s  br    br   the film consists of three simple images that are distorted using different weird camera tricks  these distorted images are accompanied by music and there is absolutely no dialog or plot of any sort  this was obviously intended as almost like a form of performance art  and like most performance art  it s interesting at first but quickly becomes tiresome  the film  to put it even more bluntly  is a total bore and would appeal to no one but perhaps those who made the film  their family and friends and perhaps a few people just too hip and  with it  to be understood by us mortals ',\n  'nine minutes of psychedelic  pulsating  often symmetric abstract images  are enough to drive anyone crazy  i did spot a full frame eye at the start  and later some birds silhouetted against other colors  it was just not my cup of tea  it s about 8½ minutes too long ',\n  'there are lots of extremely good looking people in this movie  that s probably the best thing about it  perhaps that even makes it worth watching  br    br    loaded  tells the story of tristan price  jesse metcalfe   a young man who s about to make his mark on the world  he s the son of a well to do family with a good reputation  and he s on his way to law school  but like so many such settings  things aren t quite as perfect as they appear  the expectations in this family far outweigh the love  except for school  tristan s father rarely lets him leave the house  this seems to be the result of some past traumatic event that shook the family  which is partially revealed through flashbacks but isn t spelled out until the very end  tristan s claustrophobic environment causes him to let loose in very extreme ways at the first possible opportunity  when his friends take him out to a strip club to celebrate his graduation  the celebration soon follows some strippers back to a beach house party  and from there  tristan befriends sebastian cole  corey large   who pulls him into a drug dealing underworld  br    br   while technically well made  this movie suffers from a lackluster script and a storyline that isn t very engaging  also counting against this film are some constant camera tricks that generally seemed annoying and out of place  such as slow motion  fast motion  freeze frames and echos  these are the types of effects a director might normally utilize to show a character s perspective while on drugs  except in this case they seem to have been sporadically tossed in at random points  in some cheap attempt at style  br    br   despite its cast of relative unknowns  performances were good all around  most notably with respect to the main antagonist  corey large   i suspect we ll be seeing at least a couple of these people in bigger and better projects in the future  br    br   of course  when mentioning the actors  i must mention their looks  rating based on hotness  this movies scores an 11  the women in this movie are incredible looking and almost distract you from what a boring movie you re watching  i m sure the male characters are also quite attractive  but you ll have to ask someone else to comment on that  br    br   overall  i can t recommend this movie  not for buying  renting  or even seeing for free  it s unfortunately just not worth the effort it takes to sit through ',\n  'this is it  this is the one  this is the worst movie

reason i still don t know why  i cannot believe how insanely horrific this movie is was  its so bad  so far from anything that could be considered a movie  a story or anything that should have ever been created and brought into our existence  br    br   this made me question whether or not humans are truly put on this earth to do good  it made me feel disgusted with ourselves and our progress as a species in this universe  this type of movie sincerely hurts us as a society  we should be ashamed  i really cannot emphasize that our global responsibility as people living here and creating art  is that we need to prevent the creation of these gross distortions of our reality for our own good  it s an embarrassment  i don t know how on earth any of these actors  writers  or the director of

a second or two before  i mean like  after watching the first 5 minutes before  br    br   every cheesy editing  effect  is shamelessly used over and over again to a sickening point  i really never want to see the  shaky  camera  drug buzz rush  effect or jump cuts or swerve cuts or any fancy cut ever again ever  this is meticulously boring  repetitive and just tortures the audience  br    br   but       and let me be specific here  the most disturbing thing about this movie is that given the production  it appears that a somewhat decent amount of money was actually put into this excrement  i personally will grab the shoulders of the director if i ever see him and shake him into submission  demanding that he run home and swallow two gallons of drain o or i will do it for him  br    br   if we ever needed a new form of inhumane torture for our war prisoners abroad  just keep showing them this movie in a padded cell over and over again  trust me  i think they will become more

understand  br    br   frankly  besides being able to stare at nathalie kelley and monica keena  this film has no redeeming qualities  save your money  save your time    do anything else   ',\n  'weak plot  predictable violence  only semi interesting characters  like the writer  also one of the stars   was fictionalizing his own screw ups and added an incredulous fantasies of drugs and murder to make it  hot   from the predictable rap and house soundtrack  to the family conflicts  it s poorly acted  stereotypical  and ultimately terribly boring  even the title has been done before   imdb lists five movies with the same name released in 2007 2008    br    br   note  saw it on showtime  which listed the synopsis for one of the other movies  was halfway thru before i realized no one was an undercover cop  even tho another stereotype  would have made it interesting if it happened ',\n  'all i could think of while watching this movie was b grade slop  many have spoken about it s redeeming quality is how this film portrays such a realistic representation of the effects of drugs and an individual and their subsequent spiral into a self perpetuation state of unfortunate events  yet really  the techniques used  as many have already mentioned  were overused and thus unconvincing and irrelevant to the film as a whole  br    br   as far as the plot is concerned  it was lacklustre  unimaginative  implausible and convoluted  you can read most other reports on this film and they will say pretty much the same as i would  br    br   granted some of the actors and actresses are attractive but when confronted with such boring action    looks can only carry a film so far  the action is poor and intermittent  a few punches thrown here and there  and a final gunfight towards the end  nothing really to write home about  br    br   as others have said   bad  movies are great to watch for the very reason that they are  bad   you revel in that fact  this film  however  is a void  it s nothing  br    br   furthermore  if one is really in need of an educational movie to scare people away from drug use then i would seriously recommend any number of other movies out there that board such issues in a much more effective way   requiem for a dream    trainspotting    fear and loathing in las vegas  and  candy  are just a few examples  though one should also check out some more lighthearted films on the same subject like  go   overall  both serious and funny  and  halfbaked   br    br   on a final note  the one possibly redeeming line in this movie  delivered by vinnie jones was stolen from  lock  stock and two smokling barrels   to think that a bit of that great movie has been tainted by  loaded  is vile  br    br   overall  i strongly suggest that you save you money and your time by not seeing this movie ',\n  'if you look at corey large s information here on imdb  apparently there s a movie called  reload  in production  as of june  08

  br   i watched this in the wee hours of the morning when i was battling insomnia  and so i was drifting in and out while it was on  i m sure i missed some plot points  but overall  it seemed really weak  large s performance was  for me  one of the stronger parts of the film  i m also a bit surprised at all the people commenting on the beautiful girls  since i thought the actress playing brooke

bad for the writers  it could have been good  the acting is wooden  very few of the characters are believable  br    br   who ever edited this clearly just learnt some new edit techniques and wanted to splash them all over the film  there are lots of quick  flashy  edits in almost every scene  which are clearly meant to be symbolic but just end up as annoying  br    br   i wanted to like this film and expected there to be a decent resolution to the breakdown of equilibrium but alas no  it left me feeling like i d wasted my time and the film makers had wasted their money ',\n  'this is one of the dumbest films  i ve ever seen  it rips off nearly ever type of thriller and manages to make a mess of them all  br    br   there s not a single good line or character in the whole mess  if

released  does somebody somewhere not at some stage think   oh my god this really is a load of shite  and call it a day  its crap like this that has people downloading illegally  the trailer looks like a completely different film  at least if you have download it  you haven t wasted your time or money don t waste your time  this is painful ',\n  '6 10 acting  not great but some good acting  br

br   don t waste your time with this film  it s not worth it  i gave 4 for this movie and it may be too much  characters are so over exaggerated than they can ever be in real life and some pretty unexplainable stuff happens  storywise   not in good way  because of the style this film has been filmed you get bored after 30 minutes  too many special effects  slow motions and camera shakes and fast forwards   it s always good that movie uses music to make the story go smooth but there s too many tracks in this one  in the first hour there is almost 50 50 dialogs and musics',\n  'this is really a new low in entertainment  even though there are a lot worse movies out  br    br   in the gangster   drug scene genre it is hard to have a convincing storyline  this movies does not  i mean sebastians motives for example couldn t be more far fetched and worn out cliché   then you would also need a setting of character relationships that is believable  this movie does not    br    br   sure tristan is drawn away from his family but why was that again  what s the deal with his father again that he has to ask permission to go out at his age  interesting picture though to ask about the lack and need of rebellious behavior of kids in upper class family  but this movie does not go in this direction  even though there would be the potential judging by the random backflashes  wasn t he already down and out  why does he do it again   br    br   so there are some interesting questions brought up here for a solid socially critic drama  but then again  this movie is just not  because of focusing on  cool  production techniques and special effects an not giving the characters a moment to reflect and most of all forcing the story along the path where they want it to be and not paying attention to let the story breath and naturally evolve    br    br   it wants to be a drama to not glorify abuse of substances and violence  would be political incorrect these days  wouldn t it   but on the other hand it is nothing more then a cheap action movie  like there are so so many out there  with an average set of actors and a vinnie jones who is managing to not totally ruin what s left of his reputation by doing what he always does  br    br   so all in all i    just     can t recommend it  br    br   1 for vinnie and 2 for the editing ',\n  'from the beginning of the movie  it gives the feeling the director is trying to portray something  what i mean to say that instead of the story dictating the style in which the movie should be made  he has gone in the opposite way  he had a type of move that he wanted to make  and wrote a story to suite it  and he has failed in it very badly  i guess he was trying to make a stylish movie  any way i think this movie is a total waste of time and effort  in the credit of the director  he knows the media that he is working with  what i am trying to say is i have seen worst movies than this  here at least the director knows to maintain the continuity in the movie  and the actors also have given a decent performance ',\n  'i basically skimmed through the movie but just enough to catch watch the plot was about  to tell you the truth it was kind of boring to me and at some spots it didn t make sense  the only reason i watched this movie in the first place was to see chace crawford    he is so hot  but in this movie his hair was kind of weird  but still hot  br    br   however  despite how hot chace is  it really did not make up for the film  i guess the plot isn t that bad but what really threw me over was the fact that they cuss in like every sentence  is it that hard to express your anger without saying the f word every time the cussing was annoying and the whole flashy  camera shaking thing gave me a headache  br    br   all in all  although the plot was ok  i found the film to be a bore and over dramatic  that s why i only cut to scenes with chace in it  lol anyways  not worth renting unless your a die hard fan of

horrific for mass viewing  and that a film with around 7 leading protagonists just isn t practical  but the content is not my main issue  the essence and the real gut of the novel is lost   darkness

technical level it s better than you might think with some good cinematography by future great vilmos zsigmond  future stars sally kirkland and frederic forrest can be seen briefly ',\n  'are you familiar with concept of children s artwork  while it is not the greatest picasso any three year old has ever accomplished with their fingers  you encourage them to do more  if painting is what makes them happy  there should be no reason a parent should hold that back on a child  typically  if a child loves to paint or draw  you will immediately see the groundwork of their future style  you will begin to see their true form in these very primitive doodles  well  this concept of children s artwork is how i felt about fuqua s depressingly cheap and uncreative film bait  while on all accounts it was a horrid film  it was impressive to see fuqua s style begin emerging through even the messiest of moments  if you have seen either training day or king arthur  you will be impressed with the birth of this director in his second film bait  while foxx gives a horrid  unchained performance  there are certain scenes  which define fuqua and demonstrate his brilliance behind the camera  sadly it only emerged in the final thirty minutes of the film  but if you focus just on those scenes  you will see why fuqua s name appears on so many  best of\\x85  film lists  br    br   i will never disagree with someone that fuqua s eye behind the camera is refreshing and unique  his ability to place a camera in the strangest of places to convey the simplest of emotions is shocking  i am surprised that more of hollywood hasn t jumped aboard this bandwagon  even in the silly feature bait  you are witness to fuqua s greatness  two scenes that come directly to mind are the explosion scene near the middle of the film and the horse scene close to the end  in both of these scenes i saw the director fuqua at work  alas  in the rest of this film  all i saw was a combination of nearly every action film created  the likable hero down on his luck that suddenly finds his life turned around by some unknown force is a classic structure that just needs to die in hollywood  we have seen this two often  and no matter who you are  unless you are charlie kaufmann   you cannot recreate the wheel  it is just impossible with this genre  and it is proved with bait  i was annoyed with fuqua for just sitting back and allowing this to happen  which could explain why it took me three viewings to finish this film  i was just tired of the structure  and while i hoped that fuqua would redefine it  he did not  br    br   then  there was the acting  while jamie foxx has never impressed me as an actor  i was willing to give this helmed vehicle a try  i wanted to see if he could pull off another dramatic role similar to collateral  i was under the impression that perhaps this was the film chosen to show producers that foxx could handle the role in collateral  again  i was disappointed  foxx was annoying  not in the sense that it was the way that his character was to be  but in the sense that it felt as if neither fuqua nor foxx took the time to fully train foxx on what should be ad libed and what should be used to further the plot  instead  we are downtrodden with scene over scene of foxx just trying to make the audience laugh  adding second long quips and culture statements just to keep his audience understanding that he was a comedian first  an actor second  fuqua should have stopped this immediately  foxx s jokes destroyed his character  which in turn left me with nothing solid to grasp ahold of  instead of character development  he would crack a joke  neither style worked  no joke was funny  the rest of the cast was average  by this i mean i have seen them all in similar roles  they were brining nothing new to the table  nothing solid to the story  and nothing substantial to the overall themes of the film  they were pawns filling in dead air space  fuqua had no control over this mess  and the final verdict only supports that accusation  br    br   overall  this was a sad film  with no creativity in sight and unmanaged actors just trying to upstage themselves  what originally started as a decent story eventually sunk faster into the cinematic quicksand  foxx was annoying  without character lines  and a complete bag of cheese  in each scene i saw no emotion  and when emotion was needed to convey a message  he chose to take his shirt off rather than tackle the issues  are my words harsh  i don t think so  when you watch any movie you want to see some creativity  some edible characters  and themes that seem to hit close to home  bait contained none of these  while i will give fuqua some credit for two of the scenes in this film  the remaining five hundred were disastrous  apparently  i took the bait when renting this film  but now having seen it  hopefully i can stop others from taking that curious nibble  br    br   grade     out of        for his two scenes that were fun to watch ',\n  'ah  bait  how do i hate thee  let me count the ways  1  you try to be funny  but are corny and unenjoyable  every joke is predictable and expected  and when it comes  does not inspire laughter  instead  i want to hurl  2  you try to be dramatic  but are unbelievable  the woman overacts to a terrible degree  and the  bad guy  looks like bill gates  and is about as scary as   well  bill gates   just try to imagine bill gates trying to intimidate somebody with a gun  doesn t work  does it  a lawyer  maybe  but not a gun  doesn t fit   as for jamie foxx  well  just watching him try to deliver a dramatic and heartfelt dialogue is ludicrous  and makes me want to hurl  3  you try to be action packed  but instead are dull and dragging too many times  and when the action heats up  the tripod for the camera must have been lost  for the scenes wobble more than those in the blair witch project  and i find myself nauseated  and once again i want to hurl  4  you try to be a good movie  but you failed  you failed  you failed  i would rather walk barefoot across the sahara with a pack full of beef jerky and no water  no sunscreen  and only meryl streep for company  this hell would be lovelier than a single minute more spent watching everyone in bait overact their way through an idiotically written story with bill gates for a bad guy  and let s not even talk about the massive bomb that goes off in a car that jamie foxx s character has just driven off a cliff  but somehow manages to escape   just kill me now  or do the right thing and promise me that somehow i ll never have to watch a movie that is this bad  ever again ',\n  'the premise of the movie has been explained and if you ve gotten this far you don t me to pretend that i m a movie critic  with that being said my own opinion of the movie is quite low  i m a fan of takashi miike but this goes down in the category of his not so great work along with doa 2 and 3  and some others  many   br    br   the movie seems to get a free pass because it is a takashi film and nothing takashi does can be wrong  this is a highschoolers approach to cinema  for the rest of us we ll find and hour and a half of a kid screaming for no real reason completely annoying  and yes  this does take away from the film   the pace of the film almost reaching levels of rigomortis  and the acting   well   hmmm   br    br   if one is a takashi fan you ll see it regardless to peak your interests  it lacks any originality  see the neverending story  or any character development from the lead character in the face of conflict other then a quite superficial one   br    br   as it has been pointed out this is the first film miike has been credited with co writing  but that doesn t mean much as non of what we d hope would be miike s personality would spill over into the screen  all we get are some of the token miike shots vis the director of photography  br    br   the movie had the potential to be something great  the premise is not a difficult one to run wild with  but this one seemed to have been run into the ground  br    br   my suggestion is if you re just getting into miike is go with some of the standards like gozu  ichi  and audition  then movie into his works like blue s harp  fudoh  rainy dog  bird people of china ',\n  'uninspired direction leaves a decent cast stranded in a handsome but bland adaptation  in which dialogue seems recited rather than heartfelt  and cash strapped appearances by the ghosts fail to round up any sense of awe or magic  edward woodward  as the ghost of christmas present  wobbles around on stilts and seems to be doing an impression of bernard cribbins  as scrooge  george c  scott is too wry  and he never seems to truly believe in it  which robs his performance of its effect  the scenes in which he s shown his past have as much impact as if he was half heartedly flicking through his family album  no one else seems to be putting any effort in  except frank finlay  who chronically overacts ',\n  'i was sooooo excited to see this movie after finally reading the book this week  my 13 year old son was looking forward to it too  i rented it and snuggled down to enjoy a classic holiday story brought to life on screen  br    br   boy  was i disappointed  this movie veered off from the book more times than is forgivable  george c  scott is an excellent actor but in this  it seemed that he was fully into character only about 20  of the time  the rest of the time he was quite flat  br    br   i realize that this was made in  84  pre cg effects  for the most part  but it looked to be very b movie quality  especially the encounter with jacob marley  br    br   the biggest disappointment was the fact that they left out one of the most moving parts of the story  when the spirit of christmas present takes scrooge on the whirlwind tour of the world  observing people in the bleakest of circumstances still having the light and love of christmastime  br    br   i will admit that mr  scott did a good job with the  reformed  scrooge at the end  that was a refreshing portrayal  br    br   i wish that bob cratchit had been portrayed as a little more ragged and down trodden  and tiny tim    oh don t even get me started on bad child actors   ',\n  'having seen three other versions of the same film  i am afraid for me this is by far the weakest  primarily due to scott s rather dull and leaden performance  his emotions throughout are so bland it makes it difficult to engage in the film  alistair sim portrayed the role infinitely better  when scrooge was at his meanest  you don t get the sense scott is saying the dialogue with much conviction and when he undergoes his metamorphosis he is similarly unconvincing  i cannot think of any actors in this film who match those from the alistair sim version  even the musical version  and frankly the muppets  take on this are better executed  very disappointing ',\n  'saw this movie in my english class this afternoon and was surprised by how bad this version was  don t get me wrong  george c  scott was terrific as scrooge  but the rest of the cast fails so very badly  sometimes i couldn t stop laughing at the stupid acting and the repeated line   merry christmas to everyone   other times i almost fell asleep  br    br   the movie is based on a charles dickens short story about a rich guy  who don t think christmas is nothing but humbug  after 30 minutes  the rich guy is visited by three ghosts  who persuade him to celebrate christmas after all  br    br   i can not understand how this movie  with a script so bad it must have been written in five minutes  can be so well rated  instead of this piece of garbage  i recommend to you  the bill murray comedy scrooged  that at least  was funny   ',\n  'when will the hurting stop  i never want to see another version of a christmas carol again  they keep on making movies with the same story  falling over each other in trying to make the movie better then the rest  but sadly fail to do so  as this is not a good story  moralistic  old fashioned  conservative happy thinking

the demure  small town girl his father has selected for him to marry  drawn to her innocence and simplicity  shahid agrees to the marriage barely moments after he s met her at her home in madhupur  and the young lady in question amrita rao seems equally floored by her charming suitor  the marriage is fixed for six months later  and the couple find themselves in the first throes of young  budding love  their geographical distance notwithstanding  but amrita  who s been raised by her uncle and her aunt after her parents  death  is struck by a horrible calamity just hours before the marriage  and then  it s up to shahid to play the honourable lover and to embrace her unconditionally much in the same vein as hum aapke hain koun and hum saath saath hain  barjatya s new film vivah too is on one level a family drama with an extremely idealistic premise  but sadly  the plot of this new film comes off looking way too outdated  even more far fetched than those regressive ekta kapoor soaps  and the problem is clear \\x96 you just can t relate to such squeaky clean characters who don t have one bad bone in their bodies  there are many things that work in favour of and against hindi films  and timing is one such important factor  twenty five years ago  perhaps the plot of vivah may not have felt like such a stretch  but today it just seems like the product of a mind stuck in a time warp  perhaps the film s only saving grace is the fact that it oozes sincerity from start to finish  you can make out right away that the filmmaker s intention is not to deceive  judging both by barjatya s previous films and by closely examining this new one you can safely declare that barjatya believes in a perfect world  he believes in his good as gold characters  he believes that large families can live together happily under the same roof without the slightest bumps but alas  he s unable to translate his vision to the screen  it s difficult to overlook how one dimensional his protagonists are \\x96 shahid and amrita  both virtuous and virginal \\x96 i mean  think about it  the first time they hold hands is an hour and twenty minutes into the film  barjatya may think he s returning to his maine pyar kiya roots with vivah  but truth is that the reason we embraced salman and bhagyashree in that film  or even salman and madhuri in hum aapke hain koun is because they had such fantastic chemistry  because although they were created out of the same mould as shahid and amrita in vivah  those pairs had mischief and masti  shahid and amrita are just insipid and boring for a film that relies so heavily on music to narrate its story  the filmmaker chooses a string of 70s style tunes that only further slacken the film s deadening pace  but if i had to choose just one reason to explain why vivah doesn t work for me  it s because i m not sure i can relate to any of the characters who inhabit barjatya s story  to some perhaps  vivah will give hope  that a perfect world like this is actually out there somewhere  but i m a little cynical i guess  so  give me the coquettish madhuri of hum aapke hain kaun  give me the bratty salman of maine pyar kiya  i ll even take that

police station looked like the set from heartbeat   a nauseating british series set in the 60s  this film just couldn t make its mind up what it wanted to be  a comedy or a serious examination of the undercurrents in women s friendships  if it had stuck to the former then the graveyard sex scenes and the highly stupid storming of the wedding might just have worked  i say just   but those scenes just didn t work with the tragedy in the second half  i also find it implausible that kate would ever speak to molly again after her terrible behaviour  a final note  what is a decent actress like staunton doing in this pile of poo  not to mention anna chancellor  macdowell should stick to advertising wrinkle cream ',\n  'caught this on ifc yesterday  and can t believe the positive reviews  am

they re in love  and she s so devastated over his death  she doesn t go to his funeral  much less  tell his family the  good news   by the way  how did an american get to be the headmistress of a very proper british school  janine should have been kicked off the force for her inexcusable abuse of power  but nothing happens  and she winds up boffing a con she brought in for questioning  and the less

was a comedy  wrong  it s a drama     well  up to the last third  because after the story becomes totally  abracadabrantesque   the symbolic word for a french presidential mandate  it means  close to nonsense even it the motives would like to bring a sincere feeling  br    br   what do i have left  maybe  a good duo of actress  yes  i know  they are 3 friends  but the redhead policewoman is a bit invisible for me  the tall doctoress surprises by her punch  and mcdowell delivers a fine acting as usual  all in delicate  soft and almost mute attitude  this gentleness puzzles me  because as other fine artists or directors  the same pattern is repeating over and over  in her case  it s like  whatever the movie  it s always the same character defined by her feelings  her values  who lives infinite different stories  i still don t know how to set the limit  or the fusion  between the artists and the works  br    br   another positive side of this movie is its feminine touch   the interesting different points of view  the women have each their own way of living  even if they are all single  it brings a lot of tolerance and learning to witness how a same and unique reality can be perceived in as many ways as people  br    br   finally  the movie is quite viewable  but the great final cuts the desire of a next vision ',\n  'was this meant to be a comedy or a serious drama  this film starts with a light hearted banter between three women  fine  it moves into a conflict between the women when one of them meets a man  fine  there are a few antics between them  fine  but when the plot thickens and finally becomes black i started to wonder whether i had misinterpreted the first part of the movie  it continues in this vein for a while until  in the end  it tries to go back to the original light hearted banter  but by now it s too late  it s hard to see why these women would still be talking to one another and the finale is unconvincing  truly a lesson  for british filmmakers anyway  of how not to make films  difficult to see how the producers ever convinced themselves this film would work  and the box office proved it to be a real flop  because i d never heard

acted and  as a drama  failed dismally  we re supposed to find this kids likable and nice  i found them bland and boring  the one that i really hated was ramon  he does graffiti on subway trains and

there really isn t any point in trying to pass a negative judgement that aspires to be objective on  something that has had a great effect    la maman et la putain  has surely passed into history as an influence on much of what s been done in france and elsewhere in the past thirty years and no one interested in the history of film  certainly  should be dissuaded from watching it  to express a purely subjective judgement  however  i feel compelled to disagree with almost every other review posted here and say to people   don t watch it  it s a waste of hours of your time that will just leave you feeling rather sick and angry   and by that i don t mean  sick and angry  about  the human condition  or anything so general and profound as that  because that is exactly the line that most critics have adopted in their fulsome praise of the film    an ordeal to watch in its ruthless dissection of our emotional cowardice and cruelty  and so on   and  if it really managed to put across a universally or even broadly relevant message of this sort  then the director would have good reason to be satisfied with himself  however pessimistic his conclusions may be  my beef with the film is rather that i don t see this hours long record of empty vanity and petty treachery as being justified or excused by any generally relevant message at all  all three main characters are deeply morally unattractive individuals  alexandre to the greatest degree  of course  because we see by far the most of him and because he seldom shuts up for more than thirty seconds  marie perhaps to the least degree  because we see the least of her  alexandre s affected and pretentious monologues have a kind of amusement value  of course  but the amusement wears thin as one comes more and more clearly to realize that jean pierre léaud is most likely not even acting and that  with absurd remarks like  un homme beau comme un film de nicholas ray   he really was just reproducing word for word opinions that were accepted as authentic and profound by the milieu in which he  along with the director eustache  had been living for about ten years by the time of the making of the film  i suppose if the tone of relentless superficiality and triviality had been sustained throughout 100  of the film  it might have worked as a long sardonic comedy about a particularly shallow  worthless and despicable post  68 milieu  what made  however  this viewer at least extremely angry with the director was his granting of at least one lengthy scene each to alexandre and veronika in which we are clearly expected to empathize with and feel for them as if they shared a moral universe with us  if a man can get away with living in the flat of and professing to love one woman  sleeping  mostly in this very flat  with another  and running around paris proposing marriage to yet a third  well  i suppose i can wish him the best of luck in the dog eat dog world he s chosen to create for himself  what i can t  however  in all conscience do is listen even for a moment to maudlin monologues from him in which he speaks about his  anxiety  and his  despair   the same goes double for the even more despicable veronika  whom we are shown barging drunk into the apartment and even the bed shared by marie and alexandre and behaving there with an infantile inconsistency tantamount to the most savage and heartless cruelty  as i say  if  la maman et la putain  is intended to be nothing more nor other than a portrait of alexandre  veronika and marie  three individuals whom any even halfway decent person would never admit into their company let alone their home  then i suppose there is a kind of legitimacy in praising the director for being  unflinching   though why one should even feel like  flinching  once one had consciously opted to create such thoroughly repellent characters to filmically observe i can t imagine   the problem  however  is that the director is clearly convinced   and appears to have succeeded in convincing generations of critics   that alexander  veronika and marie are somehow representative of human beings in general and of the limits of human beings  emotional capabilities  this latter idea  however  is arrant and offensive nonsense  there may indeed be an inherent fallibility and tendency to tragedy in human relations in general and sexual relations in particular  but the nature and degree of this fallibility and tendency to tragedy can only possibly be determined by people who make a sincere and serious effort to make such relations work  it surely needs no cinematic or authorial genius to convey to us the information that a man who behaves like alexandre is going to end up hated  miserable  and alone  or that women who insist on expecting love from a man like alexandre are going to end up disappointed and bitter  watch  la maman et la putain  if you re historically interested in what passed for culture and human interaction in a certain post  68 parisian milieu which was probably  unfortunately  not restricted to just a few particularly anti social types like these  but please don t make the mistake of believing that what is recorded

laugh or cry at this misrepresentation of canadian history  particularly the disservice done to the history of the mounted police in the yukon  br    br   i ll leave it to pierre berton  noted historian  born and raised in dawson city yukon  and author of the definitive history of the klondike gold rush  klondike  the last great gold rush  1896 1899 to express my exasperation with this silly movie   br    br   the american idea of an untamed frontier  subdued by individual heroes armed with six guns  was continued in the far country  another story about a cowboy from the american west   wyoming this time   driving his herd of beef cattle into gold country  the picture is a nightmare of geographical impossibilities  but the real incongruity is the major assumption on which the plot turns \\x96 that there was only one mounted policeman in all of the canadian yukon at the time of the gold rush and that he could not deal with the lawlessness  when james stewart and walter brennan reach the yukon border with their cattle  the customs shack is empty  br    br    where is the constable  asks brennan  br    br    up on the pelly river  trouble with the chilkats   someone replies  he s got a real tough job  that constable  he patrols some ten or twenty thousand square miles  sometimes he don t get home for two or three months at a time    br    br   the historical truth is that the yukon territory during the gold rush was the closest thing to a police state british north america has ever seen  the northwest mounted police was stationed in the territory in considerable numbers long before the klondike strike  they controlled every route into the yukon and they brooked no nonsense  they collected customs duties  often over the wails of the new arrivals  made arbitrary laws on the spot about river navigation  and turned men back if they didn t have enough supplies  or if they simply looked bad  in true canadian fashion  they laid down moral laws for the community  in dawson the lord s day act was strictly observed  it was a crime punishable by a fine to cut your wood on sunday  and plump young women were arrested for what the stern faced police called  giving a risqué performance in the theatre   generally nothing more than dancing suggestively on the stage in overly revealing tights  br    br   in such a community  a gunbelt was unthinkable  one notorious bad man from tombstone who tried to pack a weapon on his hip was personally disarmed by a young constable  who had just ejected him from a saloon for the heinous crime of talking too loudly  the bad man left like a lamb but protested when the policeman  upon discovering he was carrying a gun told him to hand it over   no man has yet taken a gun away from me   said the american   well  i m taking it   the constable said mildly and did so  without further resistance  so many revolvers were confiscated in dawson that they were auctioned off by the police for as little as a dollar and purchased as souvenirs to keep on the mantelpiece  br    br   in 1898  the big year of the stampede  there wasn t a serious crime \\x96 let alone a murder \\x96 in dawson  the contrast with skagway on the american side  which was a lawless town run by soapy smith  the denver confidence man  was remarkable  but in the far country dawson is seen as a community without any law  which a soapy smith character from skagway \\x96 he is called gannon in the picture \\x96 can easily control   in real life  one of smith s men who tried to cross the border had all his equipment confiscated and was frogmarched right back again by a mounted police sergeant   br    br    in the movie the lone mountie says   yes i m the law  i represent the law in the yukon territory  about fifty thousand

shot  and he does  others get shot  even walter brennan gets shot  stewart finally comes to the reluctant conclusion that he must end all the shooting with some shooting of his own  he pins on the tin star and he and the bully  gannon  blast away at each other in the inevitable western climax  br    br   to anybody with a passing knowledge of the canadian north  this bald re telling of the story

even john ford never made that many with so much quality  the curious thing about them all is how uneven they are  ford s my darling clementine is worth about two and a half of any of them  or at least two   br    br   the real hero of them besides mann and stewart is chase  chase being responsible for the brilliant red river  chase wrote far country  bend of the river  and probably some others  but none of them are as finished as my darling clementine  but then very few films  western or otherwise are   br    br   each of the five films of mann have huge gaps  or is it six  lets see  bend  far  man of the west  furies  winchester 73  and yep  six  naked spur  each have magnificent scene after magnificent scene  with fairly glaring lapses  yet so does red river  which is still the single greatest western ever made  so perfection isn t everything   br    br   but the far country has huge  huge holes  it s mawkish  and really comes alive only when stewart and mc entire are locking horns  the rest is pretty pedestrian  with the usual exception of mann s camera  mann s camera is a one man course in cinematography  it is about as good an eye as anybody who ever got behind a strip of moving film  it is almost never in the wrong place  never   br    br   the far country has one amazing moment  and as usual it comes from stewart  nobody in the history of cinema ever received physical punishment with the authority of that man  he is absolutely amazing  look at him in bend  far  winchester  and man from laramie  in bend has been beaten up and is hanging by a thread so believably and with such boiling hatred he looks like somebody displaced from dachau  in far he is shot off a raft with such violence  it looks so convincing that you wince  and of course when he is dragged through the fire in man  well you find yourself looking for the burn marks  what an actor  not to mention the moment in winchester when he is beaten up early in the hotel room  also as well as anybody ever did it   br    br   but that was mann s territory  look at gary cooper fighting with jack lord in man of the west  as painful as any fight scene ever recorded  cooper while not being quite as convincing as stewart  nevertheless is somehow his equal in looking exhausted at the end of the fight  in short  nobody but nobody but nobody ever showed the human being in extremis as well as mann   br    br   what a great  great director   br    br   see every western he ever made  they are his real monuments  even if all are scetchy  but so what  when he gets roaring with his great scenes they are as good as anybody  including ford  and his six westerns as an ensemble are the best ever done by anyone  period  br    br   thanks  anthony ',\n  'mann photographs the alberta rocky mountains in a superb fashion  and jimmy stewart and walter brennan give enjoyable performances as they always seem to do   br    br   but come on hollywood   a mountie telling the people of dawson

resembling that happened on the canadian side of the border during the klondike gold rush  mr  mann and company appear to have mistaken dawson city for deadwood  the canadian north for the american

afoul of a crooked government in the old nothwest  br    br   the main drawback is the stereotypical cynic that hollywood has always made into a hero  even when this movie was made  the cynic was the stereotypical hero  and the one stewart portrays really has few saving graces  he is kind to his two partners  and that does give him an extra dimension of credibility and likability  br    br   however  he is so piggish to everyone else  it is hard to really care for him  or to accept him  he is much like the one dimensional spaghetti western characters  cut not that bad   br    br   still

directors who sleep with their actresses   looking for a way up the ladder and dislike anyone challenging them for complete spotlight  brian krause  who i thought was dreadful  overacting to the point

to be taking over the production  andrew moxham is paul parsons  who is the brother of a victim from the first film  the film s dark humor this time takes the idea of a serial killer actually operating as director of a movie set and exploits it for all it s worth  nelson again ably slides back into his psycho role without any difficulty  with stanley as clever as ever  using his brains to commandeer a film production  killing whoever he has to in order to maintain full control of his work  letting no one stand in his way  that is until alison realizes who stanley really is  alison is the type of ambitious writer who wants to capture the essence of her subject  what motivated stanley to kill  why would he do such a thing  and what led such a man down this dark path  the humor of alison actually working with that very man is also part of the satire at the heart of this dark comedy thriller  of course  you get the inevitable showdown between alison and stanley  with a really ridiculous  unbelievable conclusion regarding the killer s fate   quite a hard pill to swallow   unlike the first film  which was photographed with sophisticated polish  director po chih leong uses unnecessary techniques which are not needed   such as shooting an all kinds of weird angles  slow motion in a sepia color  and several instances which are captured on video and rather annoy instead of

the aspect of this movie that i really hated  though  was that 90 95  of it is shot on film  but in random places  there will be 5 10 seconds where the footage is shot on video  you can tell because there is less contrast  the colors are less vivid  and the footage is clearly 30 frames per second instead of film s 24 frames per second  i m not sure if maybe these scenes had to be shot later and at that time they didn t have the money to shoot on film  i assume this is why  anyway   but it is disorienting and really makes the film look shoddier than it had to look  br    br   anyway  i ve

basicly for no reason  stanley killed the director due to creative differences  he captured the co writer due to creative differences  but what was the deal with trying to kill off the cast  no cast  no movie  he wanted it to  look real when they died   if this was supposed to be such a high budget movie  use the special effects  man  of course like the first one  the captured girl gets away  and stanley ends up getting messed up  and dissapears  woooooow  sarcasm   this movie had potential  and the saddest thing of all    the really sad part    i would watch a  cabin by the lake 3   only

lake  is a useless movie  the acting was not good and the plot wasn t even remotely interesting  br    br    cabin by the lake  is a good tv movie  the sequel was not  judd nelson was very good in the first film and put a whole lot more into his character than in this  it seemed as if he wasn t even interested in doing the sequel  his acting was good but it could have been better  i really don t want to comment on the rest of the cast because in my opinion  they re not even worth mentioning  but i ll do it  the character of alison isn t even hardly shown in the first part of the film  all of a sudden she s the center of attention next to stanley caldwell  the role didn t make sense and it should have been thought out a little better  dahlia salem was absolutely terrible  her acting was way below decent and the casting people should have looked for somebody else  anybody else  the director  mike  was a confusing character  he seemed to have a purpose for being there but it didn t seem like his death was necessary  the acting for this role was good  nothing great but better than salem s  br    br   the plot was real lousy if you think about it  stanley  who is presumed dead  makes his way onto the set of  cabin by the lake   the movie based on his script  he stumbles upon the director and in a short time  the director is dead and stanley is running the show  yeah  out of nowhere the crew is just going to let this stranger come into the picture and finish the film not knowing anything about him  there s some killings  not a whole lot  and the one s that are shown are ridiculous  one of the actresses on the set gets electrocuted while filming a scene  another character gets chewed up by a motorboat  and one gets tangled up in a plant before drowning  these writers must have been hard up for excitement  br    br   i just have to say that i was not impressed with the filming of the movie  the way that it kept changing from looking low budget back to normal started to become irritating very fast  also  the new cabin by the lake was poorly created  we aren t shown it but only in a few scenes  and the whole thing with the chain in the basement was useless  it worked in the first film only because we were shown the room a lot more  but it didn t work in this one  br    br   there were too many characters in this sequel  all of them except for a few had no reason to be there  the acting of what little is showed was really bad and   they just didn t have a purpose in this movie  br    br   all in all   return to cabin by the lake  is a sequel picking up from where the first left off   cabin by the lake  i can take but this was just not impressive  judd nelson should have avoided this one and so should you  it s nothing like the first and it went entirely too slow  nothing happened in the first hour and it continued to drag on for the second  not to mention that the writing was horrible  put this on only if you need some help getting to sleep  br    br   so  we see that stanley defies death and is still alive and well  by the way he talks  it sounds like there could be a possible third installment to a movie good just by itself  quit throwing in sequels and we may be alright  br    br    did the film makers not realize that they showed us how they filmed the lake scenes from the first one  they were all done in a tank  never  never reveal the secrets of filming   br    br   ',\n  'a decent sequel  but does not pack the punch of the original  a murderous screenwriter judd nelson assumes new identities in order to direct his

is way over the top  this movie is about a script being rewritten before going to the screen   this should have happened to this script ',\n  'return to cabin by the lake does not  in any way  stand up to the original  with only one main character  stanley  returning for the sequal  the film is not even worth the 2 hours of your time  i am a huge fan of the first film  the story line and acting was really good  but this is one movie that i will never again watch  it is basically equal to what the sequals to urban legends and blair witch were like  but with much worse acting  i ve personally seen better acting in soap operas  it is so pitiful that you just have to laugh  i  in no way  recommend this movie to anyone  watching it will just detract from the first ',\n  'i thought hedy

gushing over everything including the title sequence  now that is funny  would have us believe this is some sort of cinematic miracle  but  trust me folks  this is one of the most embarrassingly bad

thinks it appropriate to engage an impressionable  female  air traffic controller in an emotional conversation about love  just as he s plunging to his certain and fiery death   isn t it romantic

looking past the bizarre homo erotic subtexts   so over the top you really need to refer to them as supertexts  from a naked boy sitting bare butted in the sand playing the movie s twilight zone esquire theme on his little flute  to a celestial courier so campy queen y his makeup is caked on more thoroughly than the ladies    the most bizarre aspects of the movie are how it weaves such bad caricatures of national and racial stereotypes into a convoluted attempt to argue some kind of point about the universal nature and power of love  we get it  fly boys like girls in skirts and heels  and girls like  em back  and  apparently  all you have to do is cry a little to make it noble enough for your movie to get 10 stars on imdb    br    br   as for the quality of the production  the continuity editing is poor enough to induce cringing  and the lighting is  perhaps  even worse than that  but you hardly have time to notice because the script is so bad  there are games played with technicolor   whatever passes for heaven is in black and white if you can figure out the sense in that   and foreshadowing   so funny my fellow audience member who usually like movies like this actually cheered and laughed when then the doc s motorcycle finally ended up in a fiery wreck   and freeze motion   which is funniest of all because the female lead is so poor at standing still you know the stage hands were guffawing off camera   br    br   the best shots are the early ones on the beach  but  after that  it s all downhill  the  moving like an escalator is moving  staircase is hardly the odessa steps  to say the least  and i d really caution anyone from feeling like they d have to see this lame attempt at movie making on their account  the movie overall is bad enough to be funny  and that s about the best thing i can say for it ',\n  'i saw this movie recently because a friend brought it with him from nyc  after 30 minutes  i said to him   you ve got to be kidding  is this some sort of joke   he thought it was good  i told him that i thought it was probably one of the silliest movies ever made   what was it supposed to be   i asked   a propaganda movie made for children   the plot is stupid  the acting is the worst ever for most of the principals and frankly people who look at this sort of tripe and think it has anything to do with life  love or even afterlife  of which it offers an incredibly idiotic view   need some psychiatric help  please  if someone tries to get you to stick this in your dvd or video player  consider it like you would a virus

doomed almost from the start by an executive producer  rick berman  who felt compelled to artificially limit and constrict the definition of what a  star trek  series could be  which made this futuristic show increasingly anachronistic from a dramatic standpoint   the actual show runner  brannon braga  didn t help matters by his uninspired and tired rehashing of previous trek episodes and careless disregard of the franchise s internal mythology  it was painfully obvious early on that he was in it only for the paycheck   never have i seen a series  that so consistently did a disservice to a cast of talented actors  jolene blaylock excepted last so long  it is as if this entire series was produced in bubble existing outside the contemporary television landscape where the audience  even a trekker audience  is more demanding and sophisticated in their dramatic wants and desires  unfortunately it appears as if berman and braga have succeeded in convincing the higher ups at paramount that  enterprise  suffered from  franchise fatigue  and that its core audience was did not walk away but was driven off  produce a quality offering that lives up to the high ideals and standards of its predecessors and they  the audience  will come  br    br   simply put  in a teevee universe where we are given shows like  battlestar  galactica  and  the shield  the powers that be must give the viewing public a  star trek  that measures up and is dramatically competitive  it is just that straightforward and easy ',\n  'anybody who has ever been a fan of the original series  or even has a clue about the storyline should be embarrassed by this series  the borg does not come around until q brings the enterprise to the gamma sector  the klingons are never seen until kirk encounters them  the ncc 1701 was the first ship to carry the enterprise name    need i go on  berman and pilliar have made a mockery of gene roddenberry s creation  after he died  they only saw      and just went their own way  no wonder majel barrett was in every single episode of star trek until this series  i don t blame her for not being involved with this mess  poor bakula  he s a great actor  as are the entire cast  i like them all  but the storyline is tragic and ignores all of the precedents set by the original series  just check the ratings  i think more people watched deep space

enterprise is on don t watch it     ',\n  'while it s early to say how the series will evolve  i can say that the pilot was less than i thought it would be  there is still potential for the series

impressions of the pilot    br    br   the pilot had some good ideas and good themes  i liked the introduction  the show s opening credits were interesting  with the progress of exploration and a fitting theme song  scott bakula is excellent in the role of captain  br    br   where it fell short for me was largely that the story lacked the  feel  of setting out on a grand adventure  the plot of the episode itself was more a  generic  trek story with the themes of  exploration  and  first step towards space  merely subplot and subtext  were you to edit out the references to this being the first deep space mission  the plot would be hard to differentiate between the eras of enterprise  tos or tng  the central plot didn t reflect or do justice to the grand theme of the series  br    br    the plot of launching the first mission would have been grand enough without the  action   instead of isolated references to the newness of exploration  they could have been the story  get a little more nostalgic and philosophical about it  oh  for a tv show that once again would make us think   make us feel the excitement of  the wind  and being on  the sea  instead of distracting us with a rescue and a plethora of gunplay  there was way too much gunplay  br    br   we had the feeling more that humans were the  freshmen  in an established school  new kids on the block  as opposed to venturing into a largely unknown universe  sadly  the klingons landed on our doorstep instead of us finding them  that meeting could have been far more historic and far more sociological  just how do two such different societies interact  don t just hint about it  show it  br    br   i had to think of it more as  trek with an akward crew and limited technology  as opposed to  the first brave steps into the unknown   i wanted to see something newer and fresher  the series promises to have a new concept but so far i haven t seen this new  great concept  br    br   i will conclude with reiterating the sentiment that the series has potential  there are some interesting characters  bakula is wonderful  blalock has potential  the overall theme is the most interesting since we first saw kirk in a world before apollo 11  if only future episodes can do justice to this grand and wonderful theme  we will have a show which will create new legends  br    br   you shoot an arrow into the air    good luck capt  archer  br    br   to the producers  take more risks and make us  think      ',\n  'i m not a huge star trek fan  but i was looking forward to this  i was intrigued by the pre hype descriptions of the enterprise  its cramped submarine styling and rough edged technology compared to the treks we are used to  br    br   i didn t see anything all that interesting in this pilot  i found the plot to be convoluted and confusing  br    br   i will admit that i did like some of the character development   the depictions of the humans as an  adolescent  species ready to outgrow their britches was entertaining  br    br   and that vulcan babe had one hell of an incredible rack  br    br   but i don t think i m going to get hooked on this series  br    br   3 10',\n  'the earlier part of the film was rather enjoyable but towards the end it became trite  although turturro is an actor i generally like  his luzhin often resembled a bad rain man impression and the portrayal of the genius as a semi autistic man was annoying  overall it seems as if this film is trying to hard and ends up looking pompous in spite of mostly fine performances ',\n  'a movie that attempts to be far smarter than its makers are capable of producing  the movie twists and turns through miriad plot  surprises  at a desperate attempt to kep the audience guessing  offcourse puncturing the  plot  with steamy scenes they thought would help it along  br    br   james belushi is involved in this pseudo intellectual attempt and just sleep walks through the movie  the same applies for the other  actors   the plot is quite silly and tacky  whih in itelf is not such a crime  but towards the end  the tremendous plot twists get very tiresome and boring  br    br   however  the movie does manage to generate some interest in the middle  in all worth a lazy watch on a really boring day  but don t fret if you miss this one  br    br   a rather lame 4 ',\n  'if you can imagine mickey mouse as a new york street pimp  or john wayne as a communist spy  then you might believe pat boone as a juvenile delinquent on his uncle s farm in kentucky and you could conceivably enjoy this movie  br    br   this film is so stupid that it isn t even campy for a mid 1950s sexless love story  and the problem is that hollywood made such a big deal about pat boone s refusal to kiss a woman not his wife on screen before its release that the audience knows he won t kiss shirley jones so you cannot build any anticipation for the  screen consummation  of their love  it s sort of like watching a western in which the cowboys don t have guns  br    br   the story is pointless  even the title song is sung with pained enthusiasm  br    br   april love belongs in the worst film

this  being bored to death  jean arthur s character was somewhat annoying and james ellison just did not look like nor act like  buffalo bill   cooper wasn t at his best  either  sounding too wooden  this was several years before he hit his prime as an actor  br    br   in a nutshell  his western shot blanks  head up the pass and watch another oater because most of  em were far better than this one ',\n  'i have always admired susan sarandon for her integrity and honesty in her private life as well as her talents as an actor  i therefor found it strange that she would appear in a film that so distorted that facts  her character s rescue from the south pole was done by a canadian charter company from edmonton  alberta flying a canadian designed and built twin otter aircraft  the trip had been turned down by the us airforce  navy and coast guard as beyond their capabilities  the same company staged a similar rescue a few years later to bring out a man from the south pole base  i feel that the film fairly represented a very gripping subject and documented a very courageous woman facing a frightening task  i fail to see why the producers would find it necessary ignore the bravery of the rescue pilots and show the rescue plane as a usaf hercules ',\n  'warning spoilers following  superb recreation of the base in antarctica where the real events of the film took place  other than that  libelous   scandalous  filmed in canada  presumably by a largely canadian crew and cast  i caught the last half of this film recently on global television here in canada  nothing much to say other than how thoroughly appalled i was at what a blatant piece of american historical revisionist propaganda it is  and starring susan sarandon of all people  i can only assume that canadian born director roger spottiswoode was coerced to make the usaf the heroes of the film when in fact the real rescuers where a small private airline based in calgary  kenn borek air ',\n  'ok first of all the video looks like it was filmed in the 80s i was shocked to find out it was released in 2001  secondly the plot was all over the place  right off the bat the story is confusing  had there been some brief prologue or introduction the story would ve been better  also i appreciate fantasy but this film was too much  it was bizarre and badly filmed  the scenes did not flow smoothly and the characters were odd  it was hard to follow and maybe it was the translation but it was even hard to understand  i love chinese epic films but if you re looking for a chinese epic fantasy film i would recommend the promise  visually stunning  the plot is interesting and good character development  not this film  beware you will be disappointed ',\n  'zu warriors most definitely should ve been an animated series because as a movie it s like watching an old anime on acid the movie just starts out of nowhere and people just fly around fighting with metal wings and other stupid weapons until this princess sacrifices herself for her lover on a cloud or something whether this princess is a god or an angel is beyond me but soon enough this flying wind bad guy comes in and kills her while the guy with the razor wings fights some other mystical god  demon wizard thing the plot line is either not there or extremely hard to follow you need to be insanely intelligent to get this movie the plot soon follows this chinese mortal who is called upon by this god to fight the evil flying princess killing bad guy and soon we have a very badly choreographed uwe boll like fight scene complete with terrible martial arts on a mountain or something even the visuals are weird some might say they are stunning and colorful but i m going to say they are blurry and acid trip like  yes that s a word   i watched it both dubbed and with subtitles and both were equally bad and hard to understand    who am i kidding i didn t understand it at all it felt like i was watching episode 30 of some 1980 s anime and completely missed how the story began or like i started reading a comic series of 5 at number 4 because i had no clue how this thing started where it was going or how it would end i was lost the entire time i can honestly say this was one of the worst film experiences ever it was like watching inu yasha at episode 134 drunk   yeah that s right you don t know what the hell is going on don t waste your brain trying to figure this out ',\n  'this is not so much film as big budget children s television  as far as i can tell  the villain is a giant swarm of chocolate covered espresso beans  this theory seems to be verified by the fact that the subtitles refer to it as  insomnia   when it s first mentioned that a civilization had been wiped out by insomnia  i thought  wow  a nihilistic martial arts film   but no such luck  although you have to consider it experimental cinema when the villain is strangled by an old man s long  white eyebrows  zu warriors makes exactly the same amount of sense whether the subtitles are on or off  that s not a good sign  i found the special effects to be somewhere between ray harryhausen and xena  warrior princess  primitive ',\n  'watched this on dvd in original language with english subs  either the subtitling was very poor or the actual dialog doesn t make much of story and give any character development  there are quite a few hk stars in this but the movie doesn t need their presence to make it better or worse  it s just bad  the bright and colorful scenes done in cg are attractive for the sheer colors and brilliance but it can get overwhelming before long  if anything this makes me think of a child s movie with its nonstop barrage of cg  fight scenes  and crap plot  i m certain i grasped what took place in the film but the whole delivery of the story was rather lousy ',\n  ' spielberg loves the smell of sentiment in the morning  but sentiment at the expense of narrative honesty  nobody should love that     lucius shepard br    br    the color purple  takes place in the deep south during the early 1900s  and tells the story of celie and nettie  two african american sisters  the film opens with the girls playing in a field of purple flowers  an idyllic haven which is promptly shattered by the appearance of their stepfather  this motif \\x96 innocence interrupted by men \\x96 permeates the entire film  br    br   the film then launches into a series of short sequences  celie is revealed to have been twice impregnated by her stepfather  gives birth in a dirty barn  has her newborn child taken away and is forced to marry a local widow named albert johnson  a violent oaf who rapes her repeatedly  forcing her to cook  clean and look after his children  br    br   all these horrific scenes are given little screen time  and are instead surrounded by moments of pixie dust cinematography  a meddlesome symphonic score  incongruous comedy and overly exuberant camera work  the cumulative effect is like the merging of a disney cartoon and a rape movie  a jarring aesthetic which caused stanley kubrick to remark that  the color purple  made him so nauseated that he had to turn it off after ten minutes  ten minutes  he lasted a long time  br    br   the film is often said to deal which  racism    sexism  and  black culture   but this is not true  alice walker  the author of the novel upon which the film is based  claims to be a bisexual but is actually a closet lesbian  her book is a lesbian fantasy  a story of female liberation and self discovery  which paints men as violent brutes who stymie women  for walker  the only way out of this maze is for women to bond together in a kind of lesbian utopia  black sisterhood and female independence celebrated  br    br   spielberg s film  however  re frames walker s story through the lens of comforting american mythologies  this is a film in which the salvific power of christianity overcomes the natural cruelty of men  a film in which albert finds himself in various ridiculous situations  moments of misplaced comedy inserted to make him look like a bumbling fool  a film in which all the characters are derived from racist minstrel shows  the cast comprised of lecherous men  always beaming with devilish smiles and toothy grins   stereotypical fat mammies  jazz bands and gospel choirs   br    br   this is a film in which black people are naturally childlike  readily and happily accepting their social conditions  a film in which black people are over sexed  carnal sensualists dominated by violent passions  a film in which poverty and class issues are entirely invisible  albert lives in a huge house  and black men are completely inept  this is not the old south  this is the old south as derived from  gone with the wind   mgm muscals   song of the south   warner cartoons   halleluha   and banned disney movies  in other words  it s the south as seen by a child raised on 50s tv  it s all so cartoonish  so racist in the way it reduces these human beings to one dimensional ethnic stereotypes  that black novelist ishmael reed famously likened it to a nazi conspiracy  br    br   of course  in typical spielberg fashion the film ends with family bonds being healed  this reconciliation was in walker s novel  but spielberg goes further by having every character in the story reconcile with their kin  br    br   beyond walker s hate letter to black men and spielberg s bizarre caricaturing of black life  we are shown nothing of the black community  we have only the vaguest ideas as to how any of these characters make a living and no insight into how they interact with others in their community  instead  spielberg s camera jumps about  desperately fighting for our attention  one of celie s kitchen contraptions seems like it belongs in a  home alone  movie   every emotion over played  the director never stopping to just observe something or to allow a little bit of life to simply pass by  couple this with quincy jones  ridiculously  white  music  and you have one of the strangest films in cinema history  an angry feminist tract filmed by a white jew in the style of disney and griffith  scored by a black man trying to emulate john williams  br    br   problematic too is the lack of white characters  consider this  the men in this film aren t portrayed as being rough to each other  nor do they dominate women because they are brutalised by a racist society which reduces their manhood  no  they are cruel by nature  and the women  whether quietly suffering like celie or rebellious and tough like her sister  persevere and survive only because the men are too stupid to destroy them  a better film would not have focused solely on the oppression of women as it occurs among the oppressed  rather  it would have shown that it is societal abuse which has led to spousal abuse  that enslaved black women are forced to perform the very same tasks as their male counterparts  whilst still fulfilling traditional female roles  and that african american domestic violence occurs largely because of economic factors  women unable to support themselves and their children alone  br    br   and so there s a hidden ideology at work here  late in the film one character tells another that since he didn t respect his wife  she wound up getting severely beaten and imprisoned by whites  the implication is that blacks need to return to their african roots to restore their own dignity and that it is their fault that whites unjustly crush them  ie  respect one another in your poor minority community and you won t run afoul of the dominant white culture   br    br   3 10   a failure to confront sex and lesbianism  inappropriate musical numbers  countless sequence loaded with extraneous visual pizazz  incongruous comic business  emphatic music cues  and wildly hyped emotionality  all contribute to rendering  the color purple  worthless ',\n  'you may consider a couple of facts in the discussion to be spoilers  br    br   i m sorry  but spielberg didn t deserve to win any oscar for this piece  and i think the academy was right in that vote   other oscars for best actor nominations and such    that i don t know about  but it would be hard to justify  given what they were told to do and what you see in the final product   the way spielberg directs this is so contrived  so meddlesome  while watching this movie a distinction made during a film as art course i have taken was screaming at me   sentiment is honest emotion honestly rendered  sentimentality is sugary and unreal  a false view of life   this is over the top sentimentality  when in real life to two people ever begin to read out loud in synchronicity  as celie and shug avery do when sitting on the bed going over the letters from nettie they have found  there are examples of this type of faux behavior throughout the film  all the men crowding around miss millie s car and then jumping in unison like a flock of birds taking off when she goes to drive away  harpo falling through the roofs of various buildings he s working on  a cheap slapstick gag   the whole troop of revelers heading from the jook joint en masse to the chapel  as if magically entranced by the choir s singing    on and on  nothing rings true  i even wondered if harpo s name was chosen purposefully because it s his wife sophia s real name   oprah   backwards  spielberg isn t above such  cuteness   br    br   it s not that spielberg is incapable of honestly rendered action and emotion  schindler s list was amazing  deeply touching for me  and i greatly admire saving private ryan too for its realism  even if the story is a bit contrived ',\n  'this is really terrible  br    br   the only redeeming feature about this movie is that the next time people ask me what is the worst vampire movie i have ever watched  i would have a suitable reply  br    br   i think it is filmed on 35 mm so it is already tacky like hell  i wouldn t have bothered commenting but i noticed some fanboys  probably connected to the movie  had claimed that this was the best movie since the matrix  let me debunk the myths and lies  br    br   there is nothing good in the movie  everything yells tacky  the actress is ugly  the fight choreography is the worst i have ever seen  the fight scenes are unbelievably amateurish  imagine a girl flailing her arms around in a circle helplessly and delivering weak kicks which wouldn t hurt a kitten  obviously  the director just pulled people off the street to give them roles in the movie  br

effort to watch something so daft  please understand',\n  'well  you know the rest  this has to be the worst movie i ve seen in a long long time  i can only imagine that stephanie beaham had some bills to pay when taking on this role  br    br   the lead role is played by  to me  a complete unknown and i would imagine disappeared right back into obscurity right after this turkey  br    br   bruce lee led the martial arts charge in the early 70 s and since then fight scenes have to be either martial arts based or at least brutal if using street fighting techniques  this movie uses fast cuts to show off the martial arts  however  even this can t disguise the fact that the lady doesn t know how to throw a punch  an average 8 year old boy would take her apart on this showing  br    br   sorry  the only mystery on show here is how this didn t win the golden raspberry for its year ',\n  'i m in iraq right now doing a job that gives plenty of time for watching movies  we also have access to plenty of pirated movies  this gem came along with 11 other movies  and this is easily the worst i ve seen in a long time  i ve seen a few other reviews that claim this movie doesn t take itself too seriously  but really  i think that s a cover up for the fact that its horrible  it s not tongue in cheek  the writers really thought they were improving on the movie blade  this movie is just one notch above vampire assassin  which if you haven t seen  i recommend  at least that movie is so unbelievably bad that you ll laugh harder than you thought possible  this is right at that cusp of no redeeming qualities what so ever  from the bad acting  to cliché visual  ie opening credits   to the adobe premier special effects  they couldn t even get blanks for the guns  which may have to do with where the movie was filmed  but if you re going to use effects  make them close to accurate  as for the cast  it seems like they just went to a tae bo class and picked up the first not to ugly chick that walked out  once again  like ron hall in vampire assassin  don t let stunt folk act  they can t  also  the comment about this being a  return of old vampire movies    no  it s not  this is exactly what all new vampire movies are about  buffy the vampire slayer  blade  underworld  they re all about some super star fighting the vampires  this is the newest vampire genre  with bad blood  fake screams  and cheesy over acting  obviously anyone who wrote a good review about this is somehow connected to the movie  or friends of the cast  but what do i care  i paid 33 cents for it  anyway  to wrap this up  someone in their first semester of film school decided to make a movie  i give them credit because it s better than i could do  of course i also know i can t make movies so i don t

isn t as good as those movies that i have listed about  but it s better than most of the ripoffs that came out after the first  friday the 13th  film  one of those films was the 1981 canadian made  my bloody valentine   which i hated alot   valentine  is a better film than that one  but it s not saying much  the plot  a nerdy young boy is teased and pranked by a couple of his classmates at the beginning of the film  then the film moves years later when those classmates are all grown up  then they re picked off one by one  the killer is presumed to be the young boy now all grown up looking for revenge  but is it him  or could it be somebody else   valentine  has an attractive cast which includes denise richards  david boreanaz  marley shelton  jessica capshaw  and katherine heigl  they do what they can with the material they ve got  but a lackluster script doesn t really do them any justice  there are some scary moments throughout  however   br    br       out of four ',\n  'there s one line that makes it worth to rent for angel fans  everyone else  this is just a very bad horror flick  the female characters are typical horror movies females  they are wooden  annoying and dumb  you are glad when they are killed off  long live the strong female character in a horror movie  ',\n  'there are so many puns to play on the title of the spectacularly bad valentine that i don t know where to begin  i will say this though  here is a movie that makes me long for the complexity of the valentine cards we used to give out in elementary school  you know  the ones with batman exclaiming  you re a super crime fighting valentine   br    br   valentine is a slasher movie without the slightest hint of irony  one of the few horror movies in recent years that ignores the influence of scream  the villain is omniscient and nigh invulnerable  the heroes are easily scared when people run around corners and grab them by the shoulders screaming  heyijustleftmycoatbehind   the score is more overbearing than norman bates  mother  br    br   the flimsy plot follows several childhood friends  now grown up and extremely curvaceous  since the film gives them nothing else to do  they stand around and wait until a masked stalker kills them one by one  this stalker appears to be former nerd jeremy melton  who was constantly rejected by women and beaten by men in high school  with valentine s day approaching  the women begin receiving scary cards foretelling their doom  melton seems like the obvious suspect  only problem is  as numerous characters warns  in thirteen years melton could have changed his appearance to look buff and handsome  so  insert terrified gasp here  everyone is a suspect  br    br   here s problem one  in order to have any sense of suspense while watching valentine  you have to accept a reality in which a high school nerd is capable of becoming david boreanaz  nerds don t turn into angel when they grown up  they turn into older  balder nerds  he s not a terrible actor  but the script  by no less than four writers  gives him and the rest of the cast nothing to do but scream and make out  denise richards  the bustiest actress in hollywood never to star in baywatch  is especially exploited  most shamefully in the blatant excuse to get her in a bathing suit just before a crucial suspense scene  note to self  always bring a bathing suit to a valentine s day party  just because it s february doesn t mean you might not feel like taking a little dip  br    br   the slasher in valentine dresses in head to toe black with a cherub s mask  here s problem number two  the filmmakers clearly thought this would be a disturbing image to have on the head of someone who s whacking people in the face with hot irons  plain and simple  it s not  instead  it just made me wonder how a guy with a mask that covers his entire face  including his eyes and ears  can move so stealthily without bumping his shins on chairs or tables  then again  given the things the cupid killer does  maybe he can teleport and his eyes are on his hands   br    br   not only is the movie bad  it isn t even sure who the killer is  the final  twist  is more  huh   than  hah   when you re not scratching your head you re yawning  then groaning  then searching for the nearest exit  do not watch this movie  even if you re alone on valentine s day  find something  anything  else to do  you ll be glad you did ',\n  'there is no way to describe how really  really  really bad this movie is  it s a shame that i actually sat through this movie  this very tiresome and predictable movie  what s wrong with it  acting  there is not one performance that is even remotely close to even being sub par  atleast they are all very pretty   soundtrack  songs    if we get orgy on the soundtrack then everyone will know that they are watching a horror film    soundtrack  score   okay  but anyone with a keyboard can make an okay soundtrack these days  don t even get me started on the  what the hell   moments  here are a few  killer can move at the speed of light  door opens actress turns  no one is there  turns back  there is something sitting in front of her   out of now where the killer shows up with a power drill  a really big one  the filmmakers get points for at least plugging it in  but can i really believe that the killer took the time to find the power outlet to plug it in  i feel like one of the guards at the beginning of holy grail and want to say  where d you get the power drill    i could go on and on about how bad this film is but i only have 1000 words  i will give this 2 out of ten stars  one star for making me laugh and another star for all the cleavage  seriously  do not waste your time with this one ',\n  'in an attempt to bring back the teen slasher genre that was taken away by spoofs like scary movie and shriek if you know what i did last friday the 13th  valentine fails  why did people like halloween  because it was original  new and went beyond anything that s ever been done  why did they like scream  because at least it made sense  valentine is just a stupid slasher flick that has hardly any gore what so ever  the plot is so similar to halloween and urban legend it s not funny  and the moment the killer comes on screen  you know who it is  it s just sssssssssssooooooooooooo predictable  the teen slasher genre is dead get over it  br    br   0 out of 10',\n  'firstly  there are some good things about this film  but it s all cliche slasher stuff combined with a teen movie  in the advertising of this movie  that i ve seen  a large emphasis was on the fact that denise richards is in it  but she s a poor actress  and not as good looking as people try to make her out to be  not that that has anything to do with the movie   and what s with that look she gives everyone  perhaps it s part of the character  but like i said  the acting    still  the writing is fine  you know who it is all throughout the movie  and you can almost predict what is about to happen  but not in an irritating way  i think the book it s based on is probably good  judging by the plot line  but next time i ll read the book to find out rather than watch this ',\n  'this stalk and slash turkey manages to bring nothing new to an increasingly stale genre  a masked killer stalks young  pert girls and slaughters them in a variety of gruesome ways  none of which are particularly inventive  br    br   it s not scary  it s not clever  and it s not funny  so what was the point of it ',\n  'valentine is a horrible movie  this is what

believable and disturbing  br    br   the bad  the story line and plot of this movie is incredibly weak  there just wasn t much to it  the ways the killer killed his victims was very horrifying and disgusting  i do not recommend this movie to anyone who can not handle gore  br    br   overall  a good scare  but a bad story  br    br      out of      ',\n  'its plain to see why the makers of scary movie found it so easy to spoof these  teen slasher  movies  they are so unbelievably formulaic  and if valentine had been released a year or so earlier  i m sure they would have been spoofing this film too   that s if they found any actual original material to distinguish it from the screams  i know what you did last summers  and urban legends  br    br   valentine offers nothing new to this genre  except a better than usual ending which  of course  leaves lots of room for the inevitable sequel  as always  a masked psychotic killer stalks a bunch of beautiful young women  killing the main character s friends  one by one  in typically over the top style  lots of t a on display  no character development  bad acting  and overly elaborate bloodshed  br    br   the thing i can t stand about these kind of movies is that they pass themselves off as  who done its    the thing is that they aren t because the motive is only revealed once the killer has unmasked  and tells the main character who s friends have now all been murdered  usually something that was never made at all clear during the film anyway  eg  main character s mother s uncle s fishing partner kicked his friend s father s dog   everybody still left alive throughout the film is a  suspect   but they are more  red herrings  than suspects  as we all know at this point the main character manages an implausible escape and kills the unmasked psycho killer after the motive is revealed  br    br   valentine followed this formula almost to the letter                 spoiler        mini spoiler anyway                 in valentine the motive was not revealed  but more  left for you to think about given that the film didn t quite conclude in the typical  teen slash  way  the issue is only part resolved  and the goal of the lead killer may or may not have been fulfilled by surviving the bloodshed and killing almost everybody  will the killer want more  or were the demons truly vanquished  br    br   this still didn t make valentine a good film  instead it simply saved it from being as bad as usual  which still doesn t count for much  to anybody thinking of making another film along these lines  please don t  originality is so important  and its hard to see any originality coming out of this genre ',\n  '   spoilers       spoilers    are all teen slasher flicks suffering from a drought of originality  it awfully seems so  first of all  this is a noble premise that could ve been utilized well  a rejected young nerd who grows up  stalks and murders all the girls who tortured the hell out of him when he was in junior high  can t say you had nothing to work with  but this film goes through the same motions as all the other recent slashers  everything from the score to the camera angles allow us to predict exactly when a false alarm is coming and exactly when the killer will strike  we know the pattern by now  these stupid slasher movies push the credibility envelope more and more by the minute  let me ask you something  who  in their right mind  is going to surprise a friend of theirs in a dark  dreary morgue in the middle of the night and just surprise her out of the blue while she s all alone and surrounded by corpses  does that make any damn sense at all  br    br    valentine  is only occasionally innovative  one good shot involves the butchering of denise richards  character  she gets trapped inside a pool and the killer pokes at her with a chainsaw  there s some good songs in the soundtrack  including one cool track by orgy  the music video is contained in the special features section on the dvd  br    br   even the acting is mediocre at best  the actors all sleep through their roles  of course  david boreanaz is often stoic  even in his portrayal as the title character on  angel   denise richards is a fine actress  though  and she keeps a stoneface throughout the movie  br    br    valentine  is just like you d expect  pretentious  implausible  forgettable  cheesy and without a good scare in sight  don t even bother  br    br   my score  4  out of 10 ',\n  'here was no effort put into valentine to prevent it from being just another teenage slasher film  a sub genre of horror films of which we have seen entirely too many over the last decade or so  i ve heard a lot of people complaining that the film rips off several previous horror movies  including everything from halloween to prom night to carrie  and as much as i hate to be redundant  the rip off is so blatant that it is impossible not to say anything  the punch bowl over poor jeremy s head early in the film is so obviously taken from carrie that they may as well have just said it right in the movie   hey everyone  this is the director  and the following is my carrie rip off scene  enjoy     but that s just a suggestion  br    br    spoilers  the film is structured piece by piece exactly the same way that every other goofy teen thriller is structured  we get to know some girl briefly at the beginning  she gets killed  people wonder in the old oh but that stuff only happens to other people tone  and then they start to get killed  the problem here is that the director and the writers clearly and honestly want to keep the film mysterious and suspenseful  but they have no idea how to do it  take jason  for example  here is this hopelessly arrogant guy who is so full of himself and bad with women that he divides the check on a date according to what each person had  and as one of the first characters seen in the film after the brief history lesson about how bad poor jeremy was treated  he is assumed to carry some significance  besides that  and more importantly  he has the same initials as the little boy that all the girls terrorized in sixth grade  and the same initials that are signed at the bottom of all of those vicious valentine s day cards   br    br   it is not uncommon for the audience to be deliberately and sometimes successfully misled by the behavior of one or more characters that appear to be prime suspects  and jason is a perfect example of the effort  but not such a good example of a successful effort  sure  i thought for a while that he might very well be the killer  but that s not the point  we know from early on that he is terrible with women  which links him to the little boy at the beginning of the film  but then in the middle of the film  he appears at a party  smiles flirtatiously at two of the main girls  and then gives them a hateful look and walks away  disappearing from the party and from the movie with no explanation  we already know he is a cardboard character  but his role in the film was so poorly thought out that they just took him out altogether when they were done with him  br    br   on the positive side  the killer s true identity was  in fact  made difficult to predict in at least one subtle way which was also  unfortunately  yet another rip off  early in the film  when shelley stabs the killer in the leg with his own scalpel  he makes no sound  suggesting that the killer might be a female staying silent to prevent revealing herself as a female  rather than a male as everyone suspects  but then for the rest of the film  we just have this stolid  relentless  unstoppable killer with the emotionless mask and that gigantic butcher knife  director jamie blanks  who  with all due respect  looks like he had some trouble with the girls himself in the sixth grade  mentions being influenced by halloween  this is  of course  completely unnecessary  because it s so obvious from how badly he plagiarizes the film  the only difference between the killer in valentine and michael meyer s is that michael s mask was so much more effective and he didn t have a problem with nosebleeds  this stuff is shameless   br    br   at the end  there is a brief attempt to mislead us one more time as to who the killer is  complete with slow and drawn out  and the killer is  mask removal   but then we see adam s nose start to bleed as he holds kate  his often reluctant girlfriend  and we know that he s been the killer all along  nothing in the film hinted that he might be the killer until the final act  and these unexplained nosebleeds were not exactly the cleverest way to identify the true killer at the end of the film  valentine is not scary  i watched it in an empty house by myself after midnight  and i have been afraid of the dark for as long as i can remember  and even i wasn t scared   and the characters might be possible to care about if it weren t so obvious that they were just going to die  i remember being impressed by the theatrical previews  although the film was in and out of the theater s faster than battlefield earth   but the end result is the same old thing ',\n  'this movie in away was super clever  it s theme rhymes with every single horror movie ever made  valentine makes zero attempt to be original  what is valentine anyway  it s a bunch of people giving each other the same lame messages that were given to the same people a year earlier  there is nothing original in valentine   br    br   i only saw it once  and in that one viewing here are some of the films it ripped off  1 prom night 2 carrie 3 scream 4 any other horror movie in which somebody is killing somebody  br    br   i know there is more  but my mind was slowly turning into a puddle of silk so it couldn t grab them as fast as they came  br    br   valentine had no chance of being a good movie  how come every horror movie has to have a  suprise  killer  people you don t care about because their emotions take a turn every other scene  one minute a nice girl turns into an evil b  ch  then she s an insecure woman  and so on and son on  br    br   normally any horror movie  in my book  can be saved by gore  once again valentine doesn t have this  it was as if they tried to make it pg 13 but failed  so they left the edit   br    br   do not see this overly inspired  rip off unless you hate yourself  and you want to die  br    br    1 2  3   j leonard rollins ',\n  'well the reason for seeing it in the cinema was that it was a sneak preview

year later he walked out of the jungle   naked  it took him 45 years to go back   supposedly   keep the river on your right  is  a modern cannibal tale   in reality  anyone looking for some insight into cannibalism will be sadly disappointed  the first half of the movie is more like a travel log of new ginuea  mostly touting the native art  the second half relies on still photos of a peruvian cannibal tribe  but really that s about it  unless of course  you are interested in home movies of a jewish wedding  or schneerbaum introducing his former male lovers  i give up  big disappointment and not really  a modern cannibal tale     merk',\n  'so  where are the cannibals  those intrigued by the title and the  real cannibal  appeal of this film will be let down  instead  we are shown a strange man and his re visiting of a papua new guinea village full of natives  one of whom was his lover several decades prior  the man  tobias schneebaum is new york jewish as they come and somehow  this is intertwined with the documentary as he appears in his yamika in several scenes  br    br   there are no real cannibals here  only stories relayed by some of the natives and by tobias himself  not all together a bad film  very interesting and great cinematography  schneebaum remains highly likable throughout and provides us with a fascinating glimpse into a life that is about as far removed from western civilization as one can get  br    br   it s just not what it claims to be on the cover and in the plot summary  br    br   4 out of 10  kids ',\n  'well  where to begin  i guess i can start with the general complaint regarding the way in which this film is marketed  call me ignorant for not knowing of schneebaum s book before viewing the documentary that has been based off of it and decide that i have been living under some kind of a rock  but don t blame me for picking this movie up since the title and the description on the box makes no note of the fact that this  documentary  is actually a companion to said book  yeah  i felt quite stupid after viewing this little flick seeing as how the reason as to why i sat down to watch it in the first place was to get a good serving of a  modern cannibal tale   i mean  am i a fool for expecting this film to actually cover most of its story on the behavior of cannibalism in jungle tribes  i certainly didn t expect an hour and forty five minutes of one old geezer kissing his own ass by whining about every little detail of his dull and worn out life  i certainly didn t expect the insipid directing and i most notably did not foresee myself laughing so hard at tobias schneebaum and all of his off putting glory  br    br   schneebaum is indeed unlikable  the old man just rambles and bitches the entire film making the whole picture a personal tale of his even though he isn t even that interesting a character to fill a story  oh really  he was a cannibal  ninety percent of the movie is focused on next to nothing regarding schneebaum s dirty past  the only time that we really get to see some cannibal action is when tobias finally breaks his little silent treatment about what happened to him in peru and say that he had  a small piece   that s it  folks  ninety minutes of bull later and tobias schneebaum is a cannibal by three inches  it s like calling a movie  the life of a true don juan  only to see that the only the time the protagonist of said film did something sexual happened during college when he once played  just the tip   unbelievable  br    br   the directing is  indeed  superbly ghastly as there is no flow or rhythm to the story that is being told  alright  i understand that i didn t read schneebaum s volume before watching his celluloid tale of it  but i can still recognize some bad pacing and even worse editing  one minute schneebaum is talking about cruise ships and tourism and the next he s going on and on about how he can t drive and then jumps to talking about some dead relative or some failed and miserable saga in his life  i mean  jesus  can you at least slam his back story to the first part  follow up with some stuff covering his homosexuality and then end it off with a hearty look into his visit to peru  also  i don t particularly care much for schneebaum s insipid little quips on life and living  but i at least implore the old man to keep consistent with his ramblings  if i hear a guy talking about how he prefers life in the jungle i don t expect him to suddenly bitch and moan about wanting to go back home twenty minutes later  absurd  br    br   another note on the directing is the random clips from the story at hand to the small little television appearances in which our hero has appeared  while some might find the clips to be fancy little breaks from the story  the director has overused the gimmick and broken his entire film into pieces by seemingly attempting to place most of the efforts of telling the story on the old reels  br    br   the bottom line  here  is that tobias schneebaum is a fraud  pure and simple  i know that i haven t read the book  but i m still holding on to the argument that this film is totally useless by noting that a good film must stand on its own  this documentary relies way too much on the assumption that the viewer is already an avid fan of schneebaum s work and instead goes on from that assumption like a supplemental disk found on a dvd  schneebaum is both arrogant and bitchy  striking a sour combination when mixed with the fact that his story is remarkably un riveting  if you re looking for a solid piece on the nature of humans and cannibalism  turn away because  keep the river to your right  is an embarrassingly hilarious self serving rant over a man who is long overdue for a straight jacket and a gag ',\n  'i am curious is really two films in one   half of it is the sexual experimental side of lena and the other half is her curiosity with political socialism  whatever the director s intention  the two don t really mesh together  the director should have just stuck with the romantic side of lena and made a separate movie for the politics  there is a bizarre mixture of political war rallies  dr  king  serious political interviews  flopping breasts  and pubic hair  the film feels more like a fictional documentary than a movie  other than the interesting sex scenes  you ll be bored dry watching this film  unlike many other reviewers  i think the nude sexual scenes are overdone for what it is  if you want to see real porn  i m sure there are better choices  the pervasive nudity is a major distraction from whatever plot there is  i think the cast did a fine job however  they played their parts believably  there is little of the over the topness i m so used to seeing in the american films during this time ',\n  'this film  once sensational for its forward thinking politics and depictions of free love and sexual liberation  has been reduced by time to a mere curiosity  it seems absurd now that this mostly boring little film had been banned and seized by governments in many countries  given how socialistic sweden eventually became  the  radicalism  of its politics  once controversial  appear naive and almost mainstream four decades later  and its sex scenes  at one time the subject of sensational obscenity trials  look pretty tame in a modern context  nevertheless  the film and accompanying documentaries detailing its many controversies and influences remains marginally watchable as an early reliquary of 60 s youth rebellion  one part of the film that still holds up  its self consciousness with respect to the  fourth wall   every once in a while  the filmmakers film themselves making the film  the satiric playfulness of this still elicits a chuckle ',\n  'the plot line of no one sleeps is not a bad idea  and the subject matter is of quite a bit of interest  but  throughout watching this film  we were saying aloud   these filmmakers go to the trouble of finding good locations  the lighting is good  makeup and hair are good   why is the sound so bad   throughout the film the sound was echoy  garbled and much of the dialog was unintelligible  br    br   there is some good acting in this film  and i think jim thalman is really a good actor  this story  with some of the same actors  would have been worth doing as a high budget film  br    br   i just can t reiterate enough   if you have a limited budget  dedicate more to good sound  sound is as much a part of a film as the image  and it s worth doing right  could ve

putting together a 10 star classic  complete with poor attempts at poignant lines and dumb camera shots  nevertheless  despite all this  i still gave it 4 out of 10 stars  as i am biased towards movies like this  if you re a b rated fan  however  i would try too hard to find this one ',\n  'don t even ask me why i watched this  the only excuse i can come up with that i was sick with

slinging serial killer with a penchant for knocking off cops  nick mancuso phones in a performance as the cop on his trail and nancy allen manages to put in the only sympathetic role in the entire

according to british cinema magazine sight and sound it is also known as  whatever  this film has been hailed as a breath of fresh air for french cinema due to its not so common theme of sexual politics and its implications on two stupid information technology workers the film is marred by its much too evident voice over which introduces us to the main character this makes us viewers feel as if we are watching a book that is bring read  the basic premise of problems related to loneliness due to chronic sexual drought is fine but the film goes out of hand once the hero starts recounting the misery faced by him and his friend instead of sticking to its main topic the film veers in other directions leading to its downfall beware some women viewers might find not only the film but even its two heroes as moronic misogynists ',\n  'two years ago  on berlin film festival we watched the amos kollek movie  sue  in the panorama program  with a wonderful anna thomson in the leading part  it s a film about loneliness and sex  and how the one thing is compensated by the other  in the same section on the festival now we have to complain the superfluous antithesis of sue   extension du domaine de la lutte   which now tries to convince us that loneliness and having no sex is one and the same problem  but unfortunately we can t sympathize with  our hero   how he is called by the story teller   because he is unnecessarily and incomprehensibly tired of company and himself  own fault  i m sorry  i can t understand him  not enough  the writer director actor want us admitting to him  that it s not his destroyed self consciousness or the passivity of his personality  what brought him so far  but the rotten society and its image of sexuality  yes  there are some deeper insights about gender relations  but we won t follow him so far    and the point is  that there is rather any sign of reflection about his own portion to the fate  having no sex  who didn t notice yet  it s a quite depressing film    br    br   in the beginning  there had been some starts to be more accurate in sketching the situation  at the bed store the  hero  speaks about the hindrances buying a new bed  perhaps it s too broad getting up the stairs  you have to stay at home half a day    this is a satire about a character  who doesn t know taking the life and heart in hands  doing something    the movie doesn t follow this path  but handles his characters with helplessness  nobody believes  that  our hero  is able to instigate tisserand for a murder  too dull  too kind  too   passive  not to mention tisserand s complex  he has an inhibition  but he couldn t be  of course  a murderer of women    to finish  there are women and the world  it s not a device of a modern sexualized society

one of those kids movies that could have been a great suspense thriller for the kids but instead it s a tired lame home alone ripoff that isn t worth a dime  quigley is a criminal who just escaped from jail and gets his hidden million dollars from a big score and then we meet preston a frustrated kid whose room is taken over by his brothers to start a business and obviously dad treats his brothers better because they make money the same day he goes to a kid s birthday party and since his dad is a cheapo he goes on little kids rides while the other kids go on roller coasters then he receives a birthday card and a check of 11 bucks how cheap is this family  so he goes to the bank to open an account and meets the gorgeous shea stanley were her parents mets fans  he finds out he needs 200 to open a account meanwhile quigley gives his million to his banker friend and finds out the bills are marked so he will send a lackey named juice to get the unmarked ones when preston leaves his bike gets run over by quigley he s about to write a check when he spots the cops and bolts back home his parents scolded him about his busted up bike and gets grounded what  their kid got almost run over and they worried about a bike  so preston forges a million dollar check via his computer and comes back only to be escorted to the banker thinking that he s juice he gives preston the money but the real juice came and realized they been duped by a kid  so preston buys a mansion under the name macintosh gets a limo driver who says unfunny jokes and goes on a epic shopping spree then he spots shea and talks about opening his account kid you re loaded and you re talking about opening an account  we soon realized shea is actually an fbi agent tracking down quigley and his two other accomplice s then he told his cheapy dad he s got a job working for mr macintosh and spends the day riding go karts playng vr games and hanging out with his limo driver buddy then he goes out on a date with shea in a fancy restaurant what a 10 year old wining and dining a 20 something fbi agent  afterwards he takes her to a street geyser and playing around in the water messing up shea s 300 dollar dress yet she takes it well if this was a bit realistic she would slap him for messing up her expensive dress so quigley and the others still mad interrogates a little kid and quickly spills the beans and preston is being chased by quigley in a scene taken from the original script and afterwords he is hosting mr macintoshs birthday which is really his birthday when he discovers he couldn t pay for the party he sits in his chair and dad talks to macintosh which he doesn t know it s his son he s talking to and talks about preston should be a real kid and has his whole childhood ahead of him and wants preston to go home early what  an hour ago you were grilling him about his finances  so preston asks everyone to leave and sits alone pondering when quigley and the others break in to the house to make preston pay and so he faces then in a finale that rips off home alone quigley gets spun around in a ball while preston is driving a go kart juice gets hit in the groin and more antics ensue until the trio get preston cornered and when it seem all hope is lost shea and a bunch of swat guys come to save the day and so quigley and his crew get sent to jail but is there any hope for preston and shea  there is and she kisses him in the lips what  what  what  a grown woman kissed a kid in the lips  come on is she mentally disabled  i mean an fbi agent who knows the country s laws would risk her career to kiss a kid  she could get arrested on the spot  and the most creepiest part of all is that isn t goodbye and she ll see him in 6 or 7 years  oh dear and so he comes home to his family celebrating his birthday so the moral of the story is love and respect can be bought  what are they smoking  the bottom line is that is a waste of time the morals are whacked it s flat as a tortilla the kid is annoying the villains are lame the comic relief isn t funny the brothers are unlikable the dad is even worse the romantic subplot is creepy the plot s shallow and the only saving grace is the cinematography from bill pope which went on to shoot the matrix trilogy and two of the spider man films so people don t waste your money and go watch home alone instead   br    br

disappointed  first of all  no disrespect to deborah raffin but she was too mature to play a woman of 24 25  the late christopher reeve was also miscast same reason  will  according to the book was around 30  i would have love to see a little more exploration of his military life  his friend red  elly s trip to see him as that was an important part of the characters  storyline development  also miss beasley was miscast as the book mentioned her being a plus size lady  i know the movie didn t have the budget of the  bridges of madison county  which i believe was released around the same time   br    br   but to me this was a very poorly made  low budget  miscast movie  as someone mentioned  i wish that miss spenser would come out of retirement and write screenplays for her books as they ought to be  she knows her characters better than anyone  i hope that she would consider doing the casting too  the movie let me down ',\n  'i ve seen my fair share of badly thought out endings and final twists to films  but i don t recall any film that committed outright suicide like this one did  br    br   the film makers were clearly hoping that the great twist would  surprise  us all     and it did  but perhaps not in the way the directors had hoped  i was left feeling surprised that connery  harris  fishburn and capshaw had anything to do with this turkey  individually or collectively  br    br   the film up until the final thirty minutes was rather engaging and i like the way the story was unfolding and the nature of the film overall  but once the twist was revealed  the plot holes and inconsistencies were remarkable  the underlying motive for revenge was ill conceived and the ways things so neatly worked out for bobby earl was ridiculously far fetched  what s worse is that  once the twist was revealed  the remainder of the film became excruciatingly predictable  br    br   harris gave a terrific performance and connery is like morgan freeman in that he never gives a bad performance  even if the movie ain t that great  so all in all  it starts well and the unfolding keeps the viewer interested  the last 30 minutes is one of the most memorable nose dives in the history of cinema ',\n  'paul armstrong is a liberal  scottish born  professor of law at harvard  known for his passionate opposition to the death penalty  who is hired to take on the case of bobby earl  a young black man from florida who has been convicted of the rape and murder of joanie shriver  an eleven year old white girl  earl claims that his confession to the crime was obtained under duress by a sadistic police officer and that the real murderer is blair sullivan  a serial killer already under sentence of death for several other murders  armstrong visits sullivan in his cell on death row  hoping to persuade him to confess to joanie s murder  thereby saving earl from the electric chair   br    br   at first all goes well  sullivan confesses and earl is released from prison when the appeal court quashes his conviction  as this development takes place only a little after halfway through the film  it is at this point that alarm bells will start ringing in the mind of the viewer   warning  major plot twist ahead   and so it proves  the anticipated twist soon materialises  earl  it transpires  is actually guilty of the crime of which he has just been acquitted  and probably of several others as well  but hatched a diabolical plan together with sullivan in order to secure his freedom  sullivan will confess to joanie s murder if earl will murder his parents   just why sullivan wanted his parents dead is never precisely explained   armstrong now finds that he is himself in danger from the man whose life he has just saved  earl has a grudge against armstrong s wife  herself a lawyer  who acted as counsel for the prosecution in an earlier case when earl was accused of rape   br    br    just cause  is an example of the auto cannibalism in which hollywood sometimes likes to indulge  cobbling together one film by recycling themes and plot devices from a number of others  the first half owes an obvious debt to films like  intruder in the dust  and  to kill a mockingbird   about the only difference is that the sheriff who beats a confession out of bobby earl is himself black  whereas in earlier films he would have been white   police brutality is now an equal opportunities activity   the central twist in the plot was borrowed from costa gavras s  music box   although in that film the revelation does not occur until the very end  the finale  in which a lawyer  his wife and their young daughter are in danger from a former client  is an obvious plagiarism of the two versions of  cape fear   which also take place in the swamplands of the american south  ed harris  characterisation of sullivan as a bible quoting religious maniac is a direct imitation of robert de niro s character in the scorsese version of  cape fear   made four years before  just cause    br    br    there is a postscript  just as  just cause  borrowed heavily from several other movies  seven years later its central plot twist was  in its turn  to be blatantly plagiarised in the ashley judd vehicle  high crimes     br    br   the trouble with this style of film making by numbers is that the resulting films are generally much less distinguished than those which inspired them  the whole is normally very much less than the sum of the parts  and  just cause  is a much lesser film than any of those which were cannibalised to make it  harris is normally a gifted actor but this is one of his weakest performances  largely because he is not so much playing a character as playing de niro playing max cady  blair underwood is ok as bobby earl the  supposedly  innocent young man of the early scenes  but unconvincing as bobby earl the murderous psychopath of the later ones  sean connery as armstrong and laurence fishburne as the black sheriff are rather better  but neither is good enough to save the film   connery and harris were to act together in another  better  film   the rock   the following year    br    br   there is another problem with  just cause   the first half of the film looks like a standard liberal  issue  movie  anti death penalty  anti racist and critical of heavy handed policing  the second half looks more like the work of a die hard reactionary  preaching the message that all criminals are evil bastards  that the only way to deal with them is to fry them in the chair  that liberal lawyers are the useful idiots of the criminal fraternity and that police officers who beat up suspects are to be commended as heroes  the filmmakers seem to have been blissfully unaware that the plot twist casually introduced into the middle of their film had the  presumably unwanted  effect of reversing its political stance  or if they were aware of the problem they ignored it  a suitably convoluted plot was obviously thought to be more important than political consistency  4 10',\n  'just cause showcases sean connery as a harvard law prof  kate capshaw  does she still get work   as his wife  slight age difference  and

clearly never found her character and ruins every scene she s in  connery is fine as is fishbourne  but most scenes are manipulated for effect rather than truth which overlays the entirety with a sense of unreality  and the ending is simply bizarre  the film makers apparently knew when they pieced this mess together that all they needed were sweet potatoes and pumpkin pie to have thanksgiving

you really have nothing more useful to do ',\n  '1st watched 2 16 2002   4 out of 10 dir arne glimcher   mystery   thriller with too many ridiculous plot twists  despite the very talented cast this movie is way too predictable and just downright under estimates it s audience  the movie going public is not stupid and i hope will not keep filling certain stars pockets again and again despite what they are involved with  we think that this movie is going to be about something with connery s conviction against capitol punishment in the beginning but it turns out to be nothing but a standard  contrived for the audience s sake  run of the mill  let s never get it over with  thriller  we are pulled into every silly switch in character  as they are portrayed to us when it s needed in the story  and we re ready for this thing to be over way before it ends  yes there is some good acting here  especially from blair underwood  fishburne  and ed harris in a psycho supporting role but the story does not work from almost the beginning to the very long awaited end ',\n  'the performances of fishbourne  who appears strangely funny somehow  and  short featured ed harris are remarkable  unlike connery s who doesn t appear to find sense in his role and ends up in the motorial behaviour of a 80yr old man  in fact the screenplay doesn t make sense  imagine a 60 min  happy ending plot plus a sudden turn appendix without any argumental structure in respect to the characters  it s more an accident than a screenplay and may be good for examination purposes at screen wrights  schools  the more you remind the details the stronger this impression gets  the capital punishment is not an issue here  although it is a subject from the beginning  it sort of fades away without further comment  the subject matter and environment could have been good ',\n  'a pot   boiler if ever i saw one  a supposed thriller borrowing from  a time to kill    silence of the lambs   even an inverted  in the heat of the night  with a little reverse murder  a la  strangers on a train  thrown in  it fails abysmally where all the above  to a large degree  succeeded  namely  in delivering thrills  the plot seems condensed from a bigger book  making the plot developments obvious and uninvolving  while the direction lacks pace and verve  to rein in any kudos  a major twist had to be delivered along the way and here it fails palpably too  connery is clearly slowing down in his old age  barely bothering with his attempt at a us accent and besides seems too old to be the husband of hope lange and the father of those gosh   darn kids of his  he even has a father in law who seems younger than him  laurence fishburne barely gets the chance to inhabit his role and you re confused from the outset as to whether he s a bad guy or a good guy  someone once said that flashbacks shouldn t lie   they do  confusedly  here  the rest of the playing is merely average by a reasonable cast in their underwritten stereotyped roles  the supposed climax managed too  to roll by leaving me firmly entrenched in the back  not as should have been the aim  front edge of my seat  mediocre sloppy hollywood film making for sure ',\n  'this movie is a crappy and forgettable sean connery vehicle  the performances are generally crappy especially by capshaw  fishburne  and the usually solid ed harris  connery seems miscast as a harvard academic  the movie absolutely gets worse as it goes along  it is a third rate mystery that becomes extremely contrived by the time it unravels  the movie squanders an excellent supporting cast  george plimpton also turns up in a minor role to add some gravitas to connery as they debate the death penalty  the violence and the atmosphere pepper a third rate mystery thriller that is manipulation to the highest degree  the scripting and direction are extremely poor  connery s charisma and screen presence are the film s only virtue  manipulative  violent  and ridiculous  2 10 avoid it ',\n  'this is just a case of a previously worthless island changed into something worthwhile  jesus christ people lets throw a big fit over 2000 islanders big deal this

so god damn awful i flip between pure joy of seeing a godly body of traci  mandy schaffer  and cringing my eyeballs out for the disaster of a plot  br    br   spoiler alert the first scene of the movie already had me cringing   you see a woman painting something by the lakeside  in pure bliss and serene  then a beautiful girl approach and ask if she could paint beside her  when they both finished  they show each other what they had done    and the woman painted a vineyard when she is facing infront of the lake  what kind of screwball director would make this kind of mistake   and in another scene  traci gets to kill her teacher s lover by smash him with the sail pole  and then she swims away  and none of the town s police suspected her once  i mean hellooooo  mandy did not wear a glove did she  her finger prints are all over the god damn boat   after that  it gets worst  whenever mandy is around  there is the  chilling  sound effect played which sounds like a cat in hissy fit  it s also a real pity rosanna arquette s is in this movie  i feel real sorry for her to have to star in this super low budget soft porn no brainer  same goes for jürgen prochnow  who also has the

  br    br   it s possible that dana misses traci s murderous streak because truth be told  traci seems to have the criminal skills of a hamster  it s only because the script dictates so that she manages to pull off any kind of a body count  br    br   a particularly hilarious note in this movie is the character of carmen  a mexican maid who is described by dana as around so long she s like

think this was his first movie since  beverly hills cop  so at the time he was hot  considering that one made over two hundred million and it was r and this one made about 80 million and it was pg does say it was not all that popular  i have never been a big eddie murphy fan  so that is probably another reason i didn t care for it much at all  this one has eddie as some sort of finder of lost kids  he must find the golden child or the world is in terrible peril  the plot is very bad  but as bad as it is it does not compare to the special effects  i had seen better stuff done in the 70 s than some of the stuff this one offers  ray harryhausen did better stuff  still the main reason you see a movie like this is because of eddie  unfortunately he is not very funny in this one at all and it just seems stupid to put him in the  raiders of the lost ark  type scenes  i guess they were hoping for a fish out of water effect  but to me it just did not work ',\n  'unlike  the adventures of buckaroo banzai   or  big trouble in little china   or  conan the barbarian   which are horrible films that have a certain coolness and self deprecating humor that turn them into cult sensations  the golden child is just plain bad  br    br   the premise itself is not unworkable  and there are some funny moments  but here the eddy murphy  flip attitude  just deflates any feeling of tension or danger in the story  and the special effects are silly enough to do more damage to that tension  the  mystic secrets  of tibetan buddhism are lampooned rather than drawn upon to compel  br    br

the star chain  they ruin all the good work by making a bad movie  burt reynolds peaked  then started making dreadful hal needham car chase flicks  arnold schwarzenegger became the hottest property in hollywood  only to invite derision upon himself with the appalling last action hero  and here  loquacious eddie murphy erases memories of trading places and 48 hours with this  family  adventure flick  which is an unbelievably tedious  childish and generally plain awful misfire in which the chance to see charlotte lewis s great big breasts in a tight blouse is the most appealing aspect of the entire film  br    br   the story is pure humdrum  it concerns social worker murphy  contacted by mysterious types and told that he is the chosen one  chosen for what  i hear you ask  his job is to rescue a tibetan boy with mystical powers from a race of demons who want to rule the world  as the main demon  classy actor charles dance looks terribly embarrassed to be in the film  but hey  i m sure he was well paid for sacrificing his talents  of all murphy s films  this is easily the worst  i ve read some reviews which suggest that it is nice to see murphy in an atypical role  in a non formulaic kind of film  and while both points are loosely true there s no forgiving the fact that the film   however atypical and non formulaic it might be   is an absolute load of garbage  br    br   ',\n  'michael jackson would have claimed a spot for the top billed character in the golden child  and because he loves kids  that didn t work  and why should it    so instead we have eddie murphy out to save the world by rescuing  kid midas   i would strongly suggest all future scriptwriters to please thoroughly study the actor s inane dialogue in this quirky fantasy   adventure   comedy that s a step closer to ishtar  whatever murphy says or does can be best liked  but don t get me wrong about his exquisite comical talent  he doesn t belong in this movie  and the same went for dr  dolittle  the violence and visuals combined are reasons to stamp it as a cult camp classic  and that wouldn t have made any sense as hollywood and movie fanatics kept cashing in on the guy  speaking of visuals  they were pulled off amazingly well at the time of ronald reagan s presidential fame  murphy is far better at coming to america and 48 hrs  but this stale movie isn t my touch of golden honey for a sweet crunchy taste ',\n  'bad movie for sure  it s such a ridiculous fantasy with a lot of poor special effects  a lot of hasty scenes  the airport one for example   and a real unfunny time   charles

understand why or how    in one tv interview i ve heard  eddie murphy  himself  when he was nominated for an oscar 2007  regretted it in a comic way     br    br   one of the comments said  hey   it s the 1980s     well  no my friend  it s the cinematic foolishness which made a lot of razzie movies all over the years whether it s the 1980s or the 1950s    br    br   there are 2 reasons made me write about this movie  the first is that i ll never forget the long tan fascinating legs of  charlotte lewis  especially when she was on bed before the bad guys attack her house  wearing just a blue shirt and oh boy the camera was versifying about her naked legs as it should be  but how odd   as i ve watched her in following movies and she wasn t that beautiful again     anyhow the second reason is that i ve found this movie s title lately at my list of the worst 100 movies ever  br    br   the bottom line  bad movie  greeeeeat legs ',\n  'i remember when the golden child was released in 1986 it was universally panned by the critics   and i m talking panned so badly that it more or less ended the glittering career of eddie murphy so i guess this movie has something going for it br    br   it gets off to a bad start where buddist monks kneel in front of a child with a blank expression on his face   bad guys enter the temple br    br   child sits with blank expression br    br   bad guys chop up the monks br    br   child sits with blank expression br    br   bad guys pull out giant bird cage and stick the child inside who now sits with     go on guess   you do get the impression that even if they were taking him for a sleepover at michael jackson s wonderland ranch he d still give the same blank expression   this movie would be better titled the wooden child br    br   the title sequence starts and being a movie from the 1980s a pop soundtrack features heavily   obviously this might have been cool and funky at the time but now in 2004 it seems very dated   not only that but it jars completely with the somewhat bloody opening   in fact that s the main problem   and boy it s a serious one   with this movie   the whole mood seems to change from scene to scene so much so that sometimes it s like watching scenes from totally different movies spliced together   i blame the director personally but it should also be pointed out that both the screenwriter and producer should share equal blame too   did anyone know before shooting commenced what type of movie this was going to be   it s part fantasy   part martial arts   part buddy movie   part comedy and it s all crap',\n  'i will start this off by saying i couldn t get all the way through it  i picked it up on a rainy day from walmart like the rest of the reviewers on this site  i figured there wasn t any way i would regret my purchase  was i wrong or what  seriously now  who approved this project  they need to be forced to watch this movie over and over until the end of eternity  that s the only fitting punishment i can think of for releasing something this bad  the shooting reminds me of the movies i used to make for class projects on a big old vhs cam  the acting isnt much better  i think the only difference is that there are a few cool cameos  yay  who cares    shecky moskowitz is unfunny  and the ships comedian is an even bigger loser  that s about as much of the plot as i understood  br    br   overall it s the worst movie i ve ever seen  i own it on dvd and have given it to many co workers to watch  each comes back and laughs and says  wow i didnt think i d ever say i shut off an adam sandler movie 15 minutes in      br    br   my response is always  well now you can  br    br   ',\n  'i can say without a shadow of a doubt that going overboard is the single worst film i have ever seen  and yes  i have seen cujo  adam sandler is an abomination as schecky moskowitz  a wannabe comedian working on a cruise liner  that s the plot  br    br    that s it  nothing else in the film makes sense  it s all over the place like a mad man s breakfast  and not in a wacky naked gun kind of way  but more of a frustrating   throw both shoes at the t v  kind of way  even general noriega makes an appearance  for no reason i can comprehend  it certainly wasn t for humour   add to the mix miss australia  who has the worst australian accent i ve ever heared  and you have something which i won t call the worst film ever made  because going overboard doesn t even fit the basic definition of a film  i highly recomend seeing this film  as it will elevate the standing of every bad film you ever see  i guarantee the first thing you ll say after seeing a bad film will be  at least it wasn t as bad as going overboard  ',\n  'i wanted to punch the tv  watching it was torture  i hated it  never watch this movie  the terrorists are annoying  adam sandler is annoying  i normally like him but not in this one  i wanted to break the dvd  this is the most irritating film in the world  the comedian he s jealous of is obnoxious  the only remotely funny part is the rocker with the black teeth getting all the girls  it was so irritating i wanted to punch the tv  do not buy this movie unless you want to annoy someone  if you even like adam sandler a little bit  don t buy it  it will just make you hate him  do yourself a favor  if you see it in the store  hide it to put everyone out of danger of buying it  its a waste of the  1 99 i paid for it ',\n  'first  i bought it at the video store  second  i watched it  third  it was boring  fourth  it was not funny  fifth  most of the antics were lame  and last  but not least  it s not only a bad movie  it s a total fiasco  br    br   i am a huge adam sandler fan despite this disappointing and forgotten film  i pity it because it was his first movie  even if you are a huge adam sandler fan  don t bother watching this movie  instead  just take the video  board a yacht  and throw it overboard ',\n  'i am a huge adam sandler fan  and one day i was looking at the cast crew selection on one of his dvd s and saw  going overboard  and decided to go out and rent it  so i went out with a few buddies of mine and rented it  we put it on and we were shocked to see an adam sandler that didn t hit puberty yet  he looks as if he was 12 when this movie came out  i couldn t even watch 30 minutes of this crap  i didn t laugh  chuckle  or even smirk at this movie  actually the only time i smirked was when i saw how horrid this movie was  i could not believe how hard he tried to make the viewers laugh in this movie   and it didn t work once  although from seeing the horribly awful camera angles and hearing the disgusting script i realized why i had never heard of this movie    because it sucks more than anything has ever sucked before  this movie  in my opinion  was the worst movie ever made     ever ',\n  'even if you re a huge sandler fan  please don t bother with this extremely disappointing comedy  i bought this movie for  7 99  assuming it has to be at least halfway decent since my man sandler is in it and because i assumed some women would get naked  judging by the r rating and scantily clad women on the cover   well  there are quite a few scantily clad women  but none get naked  i m not sure what point this was in sandler s career  but i m guessing it was even before his snl days  i can be wrong  this is like watching one of his home movies  he might look back at a cheesy movie like this and reminisce about the good ol  times   but we  the audience  are left to dry  this is hardly a  movie   sandler does a lot of talking to the camera  and even admits at one point that this is  no budget  movie  that s right  not a low budget movie  a no budget movie   so our job is pretty much to laugh at the quirky characters  there is no steady plot  it s like an extended sketch comedy show  but a crude and badly written one  that guy who played the nasty comedian was completely annoying and it was implausible in the first place that he would receive such a mass audience  and sandler finds his comic inspiration by saying the one classic henny youngman line  take my wife  please  and the audience is on the floor  i m not even going to try to make any logic here  sure  sandler s current and recent movies are not known for making a lot of sense  the penguin in  billy madison   the midget in  happy gilmore s  happy place  but the comedy works  this is a strictly amateurish work  and even if you re curious about adam s early days in film  you still won t be interested  you re better off checking out his start on snl or maybe his underrated role in  mixed nuts   of course  the sandman is not the only actor wasted in this thankless vehicle  billy bob thornton also makes a short appearance  billy zane   titanic   has a supporting role and the great burt young  from the  rocky  movies  has a significant role   br    br   this awful comedy will most probably be collecting dust on the 99 cent rental section of your local video store  and rightfully so   br    br   my score  3  out of 10 ',\n  'this early adam sandler film could be compared to his life as a comic during the same period in 1989  his character s constant acknowledgement of his hidden comic genius and frustration regarding humorous material seems to come more from sandler than the script  the film is nothing compared to his blockbuster feature films  such as big daddy or even the corny billy maddison  unfortunately  sandler had not yet found a way to express himself in a consistent  successful and funny manner when this film was made  much like his character  the majority of the film s  jokes  come from sandler having conversations with himself  usually over his unrecognised comic talent and beating himself up because he s too ugly and can t get women  the film is hard to watch too because it doesn t treat itself like a real film  sandler talks to the camera and the viewers throughout the film  often referring to the film s low budget or questionable content  the film is ultimately awkward and embarrassing to watch  i immediately wanted to forget i even saw this film after it was over  for fear that if more found out about it  it would ruin sandler s career  pass this one up at the video store  i rented it for free and it was still a waste of time ',\n  'having decided some time ago to collect the films of billy bob thornton  on the strength of class movies like  sling blade    a simple plan  and  the man who wasn t there  amongst others   it was inevitable that there would be the odd turkey in there  what i didn t realise however  was that there could be one this bad  i ll give you an idea how incredibly poor this film is   the funniest dialogue in it goes like this   knock knock    who s there     the big stinking man    the big stinking man who     the big stinking man   is you    yes folks  it really is that bad  billy bob is only in it for about two minutes  i guess he needed the work at that time in his career   and the rest of the movie is painful  for some reason though  although it s undeniably awful  i don t hate it  that s probably because i save my ire for any high budget  special effects laden junk like  the fast and the furious  and not a  no budget  flick like this one  2 10 at a push ',\n  'worst mistake of my life  br    br   i picked this movie up at target for  5 because i figured   hey  it s sandler i can get some cheap laughs   i was wrong  completely wrong  mid way through the film all three of my friends were asleep and i was still suffering  worst plot  worst script  worst movie i have ever seen  i wanted to hit my head up against a wall for an hour  then i d stop  and you know why  because it felt damn good  upon bashing my head in i stuck that damn movie in the microwave and watched it burn    and that felt better than anything else i ve ever done  it took american psycho  army of darkness  and kill bill just to get over that crap  i hate you sandler for actually going through with this and ruining a whole day of my life                 ',\n  'this movie was so bad i couldn t sit through it without doing something else  there was no plot and no point  i was thoroughly bored and for a film about a stand up comedian  i couldn t recall one joke or funny line worthy of the description  politicians with no charisma speaking technical jargon could not be less entertaining  br    br   so how was this made  is there no quality control in film  watching the girls in bikinis was the only distraction during this horrible experience  br    br   it s hard to imagine that adam sandler who has become popular and has appeared in fine comedies was able to survive after this kind of exposure  he was not funny in the least in this movie so it proves that the writing is so vital in effective comedy ',\n  'i saw this movie about 5 years ago  and the memory of it still haunts me to this day  i was fully aware at how awful it was supposed to be going into it  so i have only myself to blame  but like most  i didn t believe all the negativity  being a sandler fan  it just seemed inconceivable one of his movies could really be that bad  i figured it was just sandler haters  i couldn t have been more wrong  br    br   what we have here is a comedy that does not contain even 1 second of anything funny

entire movie honestly  it is so unfunny it s pathetic  there is surprisingly not much crude or sexual humor  but the f word is plentiful  the budget is really low  and that also ruins the film  it takes place on a cruise ship  but it seems they only had money to rent out a small boat and only had money for 10 ship extras  one of which is billy bob thornton  the opening credits are animated

mystery comedy theatre  you know that show on the scifi channel in which some guy and his muppet machines spoof the most unwatchable horror flicks  mystery science theatre   immediately  spin off a

picked up this movie for  5 dollars at a discount book store  adam sandler is a awesome actor and i figured it would be a good movie  well  it wasn t  there was absolutely no story line at all  bad jokes  and the other comedian said  the f word  every other word he said cursing usually dosen t bother me but this was over the top  and even worse than the lack of story line was the parts when sandler would just begin talking into the camera at random parts in the movie  it reminded me of dora the explorer when they turn and look at the screen and ask you questions  and last of all is when they would randomly put in bikini shots of girls at random times in the movie  in my opinion  don t buy this movie  its a waste of money',\n  'this is definitely the worst movie adam s ever done but at this point in his life  he was just happy to have a movie  there are 3 or 4 laughs in it but i used the fast forward button through some of it  don t waste your time  i only saw it because i wanted

get a blind women to watch this and she turned it off in like 20 min  adam sandler could not find a better project than this  as for the writing  if thats what you want to call it  those responsible should be forced to watch this movie forever in hell   i believe that somewhere i read that the budget for this film was  10 000 and they were way under  did wallmart get a good deal on this  every

credit   br    br   despite that  this has to be one of the worst teen sports themed films that i have ever seen  and it strives very hard to add not only every teen and sports movie cliché from the class warfare between the feuding gymnasts to the teen romance  and  in striving to somehow deliver itself as an amateur alternative of flashdance  with the music in one of the warehouse dance scenes is even quite close to michael sembello s notable  maniac  which was made famous by flashdance  or was it the other way around    it includes similar dance sequences and worse yet  even the 80s dance and sports traditions of corny dance offs between the heroine and her antagonist s   the one who doubts her successes and abilities on the team  we saw this in trashin   a vert ramp joust  and rad  bmx dancing at the prom  although it wasn t much for competition  but rather for fun  for example  in fact  this movie is chock full of unrealistic corniness  such as the somewhat homo erotic rolling in the clothes at the salvation army with robin and her friend from the team  br    br   nonetheless  the film is about a young girl who comes from a rather poor background  to top it off in a massive need to squeeze from audiences as much sympathy as possible  she lives with her ailing mother  her obnoxious sister  and her careless  and slightly abusive  stepfather  needless to say  homelife is not so appealing  add to the mix  a talent for gymnastics  but several obstacles to joining the team  including the nuisance of her arrogant  snobby teammates  and a coach who also eventually doubts her abilities to compete well   and  of course  we can t forget that she s got eyes for one of the pretty boy preppies who is dating one of the obnoxious teammates  nor that she doesn t have a steady boyfriend  although keanu as tommy later enters the picture   could this kid be any more pathetic  and it seems that one mess after another comes along to embarrass herself in her painfully long  redundant  and clichéd quest to prove her worth to everyone  br    br   but  even the major moments of cheesiness which comprise most of the film  are hardly worth mentioning considering that the biggest distraction to this film is the horrible acting and dialog   i like how the gym coach suddenly appears at the diner in the middle of the dance off to scold the teammates   it makes episodes of  amazing stories  look like shakespeare  br    br   i imagine anyone able to locate this film and watch it these days is probably drawn to it mostly because of the nostalgic factor  for that you might be satisfied  but it is also an incredibly forced drama  so  caveat emptour ',\n  'it s not really about gymnastics  swap out the occasional training montages and it could just as easily be about archery  or microbiology  or a booger flicking tournament  instead  like every other rocky flashdance derivative that flooded the 80s market  it s about conquering adversity with stick to it iveness  rendering all social personal realities irrelevant by your lonesome   with love interest standing by of course  ronald reagan top to bottom  in short  so as a piece of cinema it s down to the details  some of the actors are quirky enough to liven things up   especially the love interest  brought to you by none other than mr  keanu reeves  warming up for ted  heroine olivia d abo s hateful alkie dad and big hair stepsister are more interesting than the sickly mom or her utterly inert bitch nemeses teammates  one of whom appears to be made of porcelain  it s my instinct to be appalled by the comic relief black guys  but on the other hand at least they re in the movie  but d abo doesn t quite convince with her awkward girl shtick  and in the absence of any other narrative focus the lack of interest in the gymnastics themselves really does matter  it s all just bodies hurtling around  and not only is the outcome of the big tournament a foregone conclusion  it s all performed by an obvious double ',\n  'i only today  picked this up at the 99 cents only store today  and i still think i got ripped off   dream to believe  is a pretty boring and unrealistic gymnastics drama and  1

gymnastic tournaments  she is often picked on during her classes and eventually she meets some wild kid named tommy  played by keanu   robin  when not in training  works part time  along with her mother and stepsister  at a laundromat owned by her abusive stepfather  eventually she is chosen to compete   br    br   overall  keanu alone and some catchy 80s tunes are what prevent me from giving this 1 star  and it s also not one of the worst movies ever  but still far from good  the dvd itself is not getting any medals either as it appears to be sourced from an old vhs and towards the end  the sound goes out of sync and when the end credits are almost over  it fades to black  even though sound can still be heard  so this can probably be passed as a bootleg  the dvd artwork makes no sense either as it has what appears to be recent photos of keanu and olivia and the background has nothing to do with the movie  as it s also not in the movie itself  so the cover s obviously photoshopped  in any case  avoid at all costs  unless you re a keanu fanatic  i probably won t be hanging to it any longer  i m probably gonna give it to the cinema snob  who s a great yt critic btw  hey  if any of you have any crappy movies that they no longer want in their sight  feel free to donate to him to keep his show running ',\n  'to movie this movie felt like one of those after school specials only lower budget and lower everything else i guess this was supposed to an inspirational movie of some sort but it didn t work for me yet some how it comes across as preachy it has very pale shades of flash dance but so what there just isn t any excitement in this movie the dialogue is contrived and clichéd to death of course the whole movie feels like a bad 80 s cliché the acting was less than stellar though that has a lot to do with what the actors were given or in this case not to work with on top of that is the poor song choices with really bad lyrics i felt embarrassed for all the actors involved they are all talented but you can t tell from this movie this is just my opinion of course but i have to give flying aka dream to believe a 1 10',\n  'what was an exciting and fairly original series by fox has degraded down to meandering tripe  during the first season  dark angel was on my weekly  must see  list  and not just because of jessica alba  br    br

jessica alba    i found the new characters that were added in the second season to be too ridiculous and amateurish  the new plotlines were stretching the continuity and credibility of the show too

winning the best actor oscar  plays an anti nazi german underground leader fighting the fascists  dragging his american wife and three children all over europe before finding refuge in the states  via the mexico border   they settle in washington with the wife s wealthy mother and brother  though a boarder residing in the manor is immediately suspicious of the newcomers and spends an awful lot of time down at the german embassy playing poker  it seems to take forever for this drama to find its focus  and when we realize what the heart of the material is  the wise  honest  direct refugees teaching the clueless  head in the sand americans how the world has suddenly changed   it seems a little patronizing  the viewer is quite literally put in the relatives  place  being lectured to  lukas has several speeches in the third act which undoubtedly won him the academy award  yet for the much of the picture he seems to do little but enter and exit  enter and exit  as his spouse  bette davis enunciates like nobody else and works her wide eyes to good advantage  but the role doesn t allow her much color  their children  all with divergent accents   are alternately humorous and annoying  and geraldine fitzgerald has a nothing role as a put upon wife  and the disgruntled texture she brings to the part seems entirely wrong   the intent here was to tastefully  tactfully show us just because a  wwii era  man may be german  that doesn t make him a nazi sympathizer  we get that in the first few minutes  the rest of this tasteful  tactful movie is made up of exposition  defensive confrontation and  ultimately  compassion  it should be a heady mix  but instead it s rather dry eyed and inert     from     ',\n  'the characters are cliched and predictable  with everyone being either snow white pure or wholly evil  the acting is too stilted for it to be bad in an amusing  over the top way  it s doubly disappointing if you re a bette davis fan  because her character is not a typically fun bette davis type character  she just gets to frown pensively a lot  br    br   on the whole  neither my wife nor i found the movie to be interesting  moving or enjoyable at all ',\n  'it as absolutely incredible to me that anyone could make the comment that this film is not preachy  it is not only oppressively preachy  but absurd  stagebound  dramatically straight jacketed  and painfully overwrought  watching it  one feels like an 8 year old child being punished by having to write  i will not become a fascist  on the blackboard 100 times  br    br   now i understand that it was made during the height of ww2  and was intended to be a brave condemnation of hitler and the terrible suffering he brought about   which anyone would whole heartedly applaud  and i m sure it accurately captured the mood of the day  but it is presented in such an immature  over obvious  sledgehammer way  it fails abysmally as a work of art  br    br   the only good performances here are from paul lukas  who brings sincerity and intensity to his role as a quietly heroic anti fascist  and lucile watson as the amusingly ill mannered rich grandmother who slowly comes to realize how dangerous the world has become  though their rootless upbringing has subjected them to all kinds of hardships  the children are ridiculously shown as robotically well behaved little snips  they do not even remotely resemble real human beings  and bette davis  a great actress  here is so one dimensionally noble i cringed every time she was on screen  her every word  her every gesture is meant to convey how supportive and understanding she is of the sacrifices her husband has to make and the great cause he is fighting for  that she must ve been wired to receive a painful electric shock if she dared allowed any hint of doubt or shading to surface in her portrayal  br    br   so yes  this is a very important film  just not a very good one ',\n  'there seems to be little in the way of middle ground where watch on the rhine is concerned  one either likes it very much  applauding its sincerity  its liberal point of view and fine acting  or else loathes its obvious propaganda  mediocre dialogue  cardboard characters and overall tendentiousness  i fall very much in the latter category  and found the film and play   concerning the activities of european refugees in washington during wartime  a crushing bore  worthwhile mostly for the acting  and even then only intermittently  that author lillian hellman was on the side of the angels is irrelevant  her plays were written for people who shared her point of view  and she seldom explored ideas that weren t already held by the author and audience except to point out how dreadful the  other side  is  even when i find myself in one hundred percent agreement with what she has to say   as in rhine  i still can t stand the way she says it  her characters are unreal  and while her ear for dialogue shows a certain facility for the way people talk she possesses no real brilliance or originality  she really had nothing new to say  i thoroughly agree with the late mary mccarthy s long overdue dismantling of hellman reputation some years ago  for those who think the theatre is dead or in extremis and yearn for the good old days  i urge a peek at watch on the rhine  as bad in its way as angels in america  which only goes to show that the theatre had one foot in the grave sixty years ago ',\n  'the sign of a classic movie is that it ages like a fine red wine  this movie is no cabarnet and certainly no casablanca  i agree with the other reviewers that the children in the movie are an unfortunate mutation that now plagues us nightly in sit coms and the dialogue is stilted and preachy  but let s look at the obsolete theme of the movie  br    br   with the passage of sixty plus years of history comes wisdom  since watch on the rhine  author lillian hellman has been exposed as a bidenesque plagiarist with her so called real life story  julia  from her book  pentimento   as one of the most odious of a plethora of western based ussr apologists  it is obvious her theme in the play and movie was to stir america to action to save the bloody soviet dictator stalin and international communism from the fascists  who had just proved their military superiority in spain  br    br   as one reviewer correctly noted  this is not a pro american play and movie  as lillian went to her grave an american loathing communist  this film chronicles that familiar smug stupidity of the intellectual elites that made up the american left then  just as now the full mooner left of the daily kos and michael moore has bought into the conspiracy theories and once again given aid and comfort to those who would destroy america ',\n  'when i was younger i really enjoyed watching bad television  we ve all been guilty of it at some time or another  but my excuse for watching things like  buck rogers in the 25th century  and  silver spoons  is this  i was young and naive  ignorant of what makes a show really worthwhile  br    br   thankfully  i now appreciate the good stuff  stargate sg 1 is not good  the 12 year old me would love every hackneyed bit of it  every line of stilted dialogue  every bit of needless technobabble  the writing is beyond insipid  so bland and uninspired it makes one miss star trek  voyager  if your show makes me long for the worst trek show ever  you re in trouble  br    br   the film stargate is a wonderful guilty pleasure  anchored by two solid performances by james spader and kurt russell  full of fascinating egyptian architecture and culture  a wonderful musical score  and cool sci fi ideas  with the exception of a little of the original music  none of what made the film fun appears in this show  even richard dean anderson  who made macgyver watchable and legend interesting  seems like he s half asleep most episodes  br    br   the budget must have been very low because the sets sometimes look like somebody s basement  the cinematography isn t much better  as vanilla and dull as the scripts  it amazes me that shows with a lot more style  like farscape  and substance  like the reimagined battlestar galactica  have smaller  less rabid fanbases than this pap  it just doesn t deserve it ',\n  'i cannot believe how popular this show is  i consider myself an avid sci fi fan  i have read countless sci fi novels and have enjoyed many sci fi movies and tv shows  i really wouldn t even consider this true sci fi  every episode i have sat through was like a lame  watered down version of a star trek episode  minus anything that might make it interesting or exciting  br    br   it s basically a bunch of people standing around in army fatigues  talking about something boring  who occasionally go through the stargate and end up on a planet that looks just like earth  with people who look and sound just like humans  it seemed extremely low budget  the characters are all forgettable one dimensional cutouts  and the many attempts at humor fall flat  it reminds me when you see a commercial with a famous athlete in it  trying to be funny  but he is not  it is just sad  br    br   the movie was terrible as well  there is so much you can do with a portal through space  yet every place the army people go is boring  this shows no imagination  i actually thought the tv series  alien nation  from a few years back  based on the movie alien nation  was much better  that show actually had good story lines and decent characters  i wasn t crazy about  alien nation   but compared to this overrated crap  it was great  br    br   also  unlike the great new  battlestar galactica  series   stargate  copied the look and feel of the lame movie too closely  they should have at least updated the cheesy  toilet flushing  special effect of whenever somebody goes through the stargate ',\n  'im watching it now on pink  serbia tv station  and i must say this is a crap  shallow  no acting  effects too sloppy i mean  who made this series  br    br   this was a stupid attempt of the studios to make some more money on the success of the film  ok  the film was great in 1994 when it came out  but the series  br    br   some times you can see how idiotic the lines are in the speech of the characters  i mean  did they actually pay someone to write that  was that someones relative at the studio  this is no scifi  br    br   the film was the bomb  the series suck ',\n  'having seen the first ten episodes  i must say this show sucks   br    br   what bothers me the most  is that the show was shot in canada  i know it s cheaper  but they should have shot it in california  so we could have had scenes in the desert  that would have been more true to the movie  the first scene where they are outside in another world is in the mountains  with lots of pinetrees where it looks cold  that does nt feel very egyptian  what worked so well in the movie was that it felt like you were in the ancient egypt  here it feels like they re running around fighting aliens in a canadian forrest  and it s so lame that appaerantly  on other planets  the fall comes as well  you can see leaves on the ground in the forrests that all look like forrests outside vancouver  it just makes the show even more unbelievable and dumb   br    br   and then there is richard dean anderson  he is no kurt russel  sure he does a decent job and he tries to copy russels performance a little bit  but he is just not as cool as russel  and not nearly as good an actor as russel  and russells way of playing o neill  well he was much more cynical  andersons o neil  is way too soft  i liked it that russels version just did nt give a s    and had no trouble detonating the bomb until the very end of the movie   br    br   michael shanks does a really good job as jackson though taking over from james spader  br    br   teal c is a really annoying character  he is jaffa  not a jaffa  just jaffa  aaaarrgh   a former bodyguard of a pathetic ra character  seen only in the pilot and in one other episode so far  teal c speaks talks and acts like a robot  i ve seen better acting from jean claude van damme  br    br   and the fact that teal c and the ra character and the people they saved in the movie  can speak english all of a sudden is also incredibly dumb  what made the aliens so scary in the movie was that they spoke an ancient language and were real monsters   br    br   as for the special effects  they are really good in the pilot  but the very rare effects in the actual show are badly done and looks cheap  especially a planet they visit with crystals  it s so obvious they walk around on a soundstage with a badly made painting in the background  it s an insult to us viewers that they made it look so cheap  especially when they could have made it in front of a bluescreen with cgi backgrounds   br    br   the x files had better effects when they aired their first episodes in 1993  that was 4 years before sg 1 started  and they did nt have the apparent two million dollar budget per episode  that sg 1 supposedly had  they must have spend all the money on catering  because i don t see it on the screen   br    br   incredibly boring and pointless show  that could have been great if they had shot the show in hollywood with a bigger budget and better writers and better characters ',\n  '1 how is it that everyone can understand each other perfectly without devices like universal translators or translator microbes  did the creators of this show realize that people who were taken from different parts of the earth  in different time frames  attilla the hun wasn t a contemporary of preliterate hellenic cultures  nor were the vikings contemporary to the pyramid builders  speak different languages and can never develop a language so similar to modern day english except for the inflections they  do not  use   which has been influenced by latin  ancient greek  danish and french   br    br   2 cultural differences can t be overcome so easily  trust has to be won  yet everywhere the team arrives they are welcomed without any suspicion and start ordering people around like they are their appointed leaders  of course real fans would comment that they are perceived as gods  the people they meet should be shocked by their technology and accuse them of witchcraft and the like  br    br   3 historical background  none  visually it might vaguely remind you of greek or viking culture  but anyone can dress in a bunch of tablecloths or run to a local costume rental for a plastic helmet with horns and claim to look the part  a small town theater group probably has better props  br    br   4 boring  another lame canuck production  which inexplicably ran for ten long years  as a kids show it could make the grade  but anyone who has a little knowledge about human behavior and language couldn t bear to even watch the first twelve episodes of season 1  like i just did  i very much wanted to believe i had found a decent sci fi show  otherwise i would shut it of and cleansed my computer of this refuge after the first five minutes ',\n  'the episodic version of robert heinlein s starship troopers plays out at a deathly slow pace  following johnny rico leaving his parents  the  not very attractive  girl he lusts for  and joining the mobile infantry  the aliens in the show are nothing like the barbaric bugs from the film  instead being squid like monsters that shoot lasers out of their mouths  br    br   throughout watching this version  i was continually amazed at just how fruity they ve managed to make the whole thing  the show is concerned mostly with the relationships between the recruits  and the aching  prolonged gazes they give each other through their battle armour visors  with 80s synth pop sometimes arriving  during  the sparse battle sequences which at last turning up in the final few episodes  in terms of construction  it owes a debt to top gun  sharing much in terms of pacing and content  and all that implies  ',\n  'you d better choose paul verhoeven s even if you have watched it ',\n  'the plot of this terrible film is so convoluted i ve put the spoiler warning up because i m unsure if i m giving anything away  the audience first sees some man in jack the ripper garb murder an old man in an alley a hundred years ago  then we re up to modern day and a young australian couple is looking for a house  we re given an unbelievably long tour of this house and the husband sees a figure in an old mirror  some 105 year old woman lived there  there are also large iron panels covering a wall in the den  an old fashioned straight razor falls out when they re renovating and the husband keeps it  i guess he becomes possessed by the razor because he starts having weird dreams  oh yeah  the couple is unable to have a baby because the husband is firing blanks   br    br   some mold seems to be climbing up the wall after the couple removes the iron panels and the mold has the shape of a person  late in the story there is a plot about a large cache of money   the husband murders the body guard   a co worker and steals the money  his wife is suddenly pregnant   br    br   what the hell is going on   who knows   nothing is explained  was the 105 year old woman the child of the serial killer  the baby sister  why were iron panels put on the wall  how would that keep the serial killer contained in the cellar  was he locked down there by his family   starved to death or just concealed  who is mr  hobbs and why is he so desperate to get the iron panels   he s never seen again  why was the serial killer killing people  we only see the one old man murdered  was there a pattern or motive or something   why does the wife suddenly become pregnant  is it the demon spawn of the serial killer  has he managed to infiltrate the husband s semen  and why  if the husband was able to subdue and murder a huge  burly security guard  is he unable to overpower his wife  and just how powerful is the voltage system in australia that it would knock him across the room simply cutting a light wire  and why does the wife stay in the house  is she now possessed by the serial killer  is the baby going to be the killer reincarnated   br    br   this movie was such a frustrating experience i wanted to call my pbs station and ask for my money back  the only enjoyable aspect of this story was seeing the husband running around in just his boxer shorts for a lot of the time  but even that couldn t redeem this muddled  incoherent mess ',\n  '   that jamie foxx would ever deliver such a wonderful  oscar winning performance  one of the reasons why i was so impressed with foxx s performance in  ray  was because from watching his hammy  obnoxious acting in movies like  bait  and  booty call   i would never imagine he would ever hold the oscar  if people told me five years ago that jamie foxx was one day going to win an oscar  i would laugh right in their faces  who knows  maybe he s better off sticking to drama  because if you watch  bait   it s clearly evident that comedy is not his forte  i swear  jamie mugs so much in this movie that i m surprised his face didn t fall off  and why does he have to do those stupid voices at every chance he gets  anyone familiar with comedians like bob newhart and steven wright knows that doing comedy doesn t require being loud and obnoxious  if a joke is funny  it s funny  if it s not funny  then doing some crazy accent is not going to make it any funnier  the problem i have with some comedians who decide to try acting is that they favor getting laughs over being in character  in real life  normal people don t always have witty comebacks and quips  like albert brooks said in an interview discussing his character in  taxi driver   it s important to be funny as your character  rather than be funny as a comedian  a prime example of jamie violating that rule is the nauseatingly awful scene where his mug shots are being taken  and he starts posing for the photographs like a model  if a regular person were being thrown in jail  would he really be acting goofy while having his mug shots taken  and wouldn t the police try to scold him if he was  there are many scenes like that throughout the film  another awful sequence is one where jamie is on the unwittingly on the phone with the villain  and he starts doing a phony caribbean accent  not funny  not to mention jamie never seems to acknowledge the timing of a joke  giving a comedic performance requires patience  whereas he goes straight to the punchline  whether it s the right time for it or not  i m not even a big mike epps fan  but even his performance is good in comparison to jamie s  as a matter of fact  this is the first time i felt somewhat relieved whenever he would appear on screen  epps has the same flaws when it comes to comedy  but at least he chooses a more low key approach  one of the few bright spots in this clunker of a comedy is david morse  a highly underrated actor mostly known for his supporting roles as villains  he seems to be the only actor in the film concerned with grounding it in reality  however  fellow  green mile  star doug hutchison is disgustingly over the top as the villain  a big surprise  considering he gave a superb performance in  the green mile   also playing a heavy  antoine fuqua has proved his directing chops in movies like  the replacement killers  and  training day   even in  bait   he shows he can direct a hell of an action sequence  his only problem seemed to be in disciplining jamie foxx  who probably improvised half the script with one bad joke after another  unless you re a die hard fan of foxx  please don t take the bait ',\n  'after a day at work  i sat down to relax and turned on the movie channels  the movie came up on the guide and sounded interesting so i tuned in just before it started  the first 30 minutes were enough to make me interested  but the lack of acting ability in jamie foxx and the slow plot movement made me want to get up and find food during the movie  if there is any credit to be given for acting in this movie it should go to david morse who at least tries to make the movie interesting  all in all  don t plan on impressing your friends by picking this one as a renter for a movie night ',\n  'jamie foxx is my favorite comedian  however  i feel that he sold out in order to gain his first big budget lead role  foxx follows in the footsteps of the likes of chris tucker  martin lawrence and dave chapple  who have all seen their talents wasted by stereotyping producers who think black males who commit pretty crimes is a funny concept  see  money talks  blue streak   br    br   okay i laughed a few times and granted all of these comedians continue to pick up hilarious roles  but i would love to see these guys branch out ala marlon wayans portrayal in requiem to a dream  or in living color s tommy davidson and damon wayans moving performances in spike lee s satire bamboozled ',\n  'jamie foxx is fun but this movie has been done before  the bad guy plays a  malkovichian  character from  in the line of fire   the cops will do anything to find the bad guy   and of course the good guy has two sets of bad guys and one set of cops after him   all the while he is just trying to turn over a new leaf   ',\n  'well  i can and will be very short  this is a wrong balanced  non convincing film that could have been a little bit better  the script seems to not know which way to go     from funny to cliche wise serious    it s a bit silly  that plus too much sentences we have heard before  the hacker is in florida  or no  he is in madrid  no he is in

people in the audience thought it was very funny when he made a face to the camera  or for saying  i am going to take a shower   br    br   the plot is completely predictable  the bad guy comes after the good guy  the good guy has a woman  so the bad guy uses her  in between  the officials screwing up  the final scenes are utterly unbelievable  you spend 2 years and millions of dollars chasing a guy  but you don t do your home work to solve a trivial riddle  br    br   there s no great acting  there isn t much of a plot or storyline  and the shooting is done mtv style  don t waste your money on this one  br    br   ',\n  'i love jamie foxx  br    br   and i enjoy 99  of all movies i see  br    br   and i walked out of this one  br    br   now  i admit  it may have had something to do with the two middle aged white women in the back of theatre who laughed at every little thing   oh no  jamie s knocking on a door  hee hee hee     but    this was just so incredibly annoying  there could be no sustained camera shot  and no camera shot from a conventional angle    everything had to be in your face  loud  and annoying  br    br   the bad guy tried to be smooth and malkovich like  but at this point  it s just old and tired  he brought nothing new or interesting  from all the characters  too many lines you saw coming  too many you ve heard before  and too many  tough guy  lines    and i don t mind that sort of thing  really  as long as there s a bit of originality to it  in fact  pretty much the entire supporting cast just sucked  br    br   i love jamie foxx  and i think he s really funny  and i thought he was funny in this movie    but not nearly funny enough for me to endure everything else   br    br   this movie needed less shoot em up  less annoying camera shots  more emotion  more feeling  and more jamie foxx  i gave it a 2 ',\n  'what  is jamie foxx supposed to be funny does he really believe he is funny well  it s funny watching his confidence in being funny the man has no identity whatsoever   i mean you can immediately see who his idols are  denzel washington and martin lawrence  because he tries really hard to imitate them in most of his movies the only

would always defend a director s freedom to create his own reality in a movie i cannot make sense of turning artimisia s life story on its head  very disappointing choice by the makers of this film

she stands for  had been reduced to a standard hollywood  female character  a pitiful  physically flawless  helpless little creature  displaying none of the character traits that actually got her that place in history which was being mutilated here  sadder yet  was to see that a great part of the audience was too badly educated in the area to comprehend the incredible gap between the message conveyed in the film  and reality  to portray the artist as someone in love with her real life rapist  someone whom she in reality accused of raping her even when under torture  just plain pisses me

understood this from the movie  probably not  tassi was not a noble character  he raped artemisia  it was not love  it was rape  he did not claim to accept false charges of rape to stop her from suffering while she was tortured  according to the rape transcripts he continued to claim that he never carnally knew artemisia  aka had sex with  while she states over and over again  it s true   br

that all too often makes its living by distorting  rather than retelling  history  along with some fairly decent set design  valentina cervi s physical charms are the primary asset of this movie  and it s obvious from the beginning that the filmmakers were aware of this too  they waste no time in contriving various  erotic  sequences which have far more to do with titillation than with plot or character development  unfortunately  the appeal of seeing a pretty young girl in a state of feigned sexual arousal cannot  and does not  sustain this movie  the acting is unremarkable  and the score is all too generic despite an interesting chord or two  the cinematography is ok  and there are some pretty colors  but there are also some pretty ridiculous sequences using distorted lens effects more appropriate for a 1960s freakout movie than a costume drama  in any event  the script leaves the camera dwelling all too often on artemisia s body  and all too seldom on her paintings  br    br   all told  a near complete failure  it s not intelligent or tasteful enough to be a serious film  and it s too slow and pretentious to work as soft core pornography  so the french can fail  after all ',\n  'it figures this is a french film  lol  with the emphasis on young girls with much older men   why is it the french are so fixated on this kind of thing  when the age difference is this great

the actor playing tassi  her painting instructor  looks   well  50 is kind  br    br   other posters have done the work of explaining the historical record  unusually detailed in this case  of the real artemisia  a great artist and one of the earliest recognized female painters of this period  17th century   her story speaks to us in modern times particularly because of the age old accusation that  all great artists were men     she pretty much blasts that assertion to bits    and because the story of her rape trial is so poignant  not only was she clearly assaulted  and forced into a degrading sexual relationship  because in those days marriage to your assaulter was the only way to avoid social shame   but tassi was a serial rapist and possibly killed his wife and child  br    br   the movie does a terrible disservice by inverting this truly fascinating and remarkable real life story    very dramatic and not in need of any  spicing up     because in some weird frencified way  it s  hotter  to have an oversexed teenager drawing male sexual organs and having a hot love affair with a man old enough to be her grandfather  that s  sexy     the truth is boring and seems too feminist politically correct  br    br   it also disturbs me that this is only part of artemisia life considered interesting enough to film  the fact that she painted for decades  her famous painting of judith beheading holfernes was painted after  not before the rape   that she was the first woman admitted to the prestigious florentine academy  that she went on to have children   oh that s boring stuff  after all  that s about a middle aged woman and they aren t  hot  like teenagers  br    br   i understand that there is a lot of creative license in making a film  or a book  about a real historical character  you need to create dialog  have subplots  create dramatic structure  certainly some details can be sacrificed    it s no big deal if the dates are moved a few years  or if artemisia is played by a blonde actress  when we know from her self portraits that she was a brunette   and a big boned one  not a skinny minny   or something like that  but to turn her story around on her  and make rape into a romance is actually sick and disturbing  it s even worse because the director is female  she should be horribly ashamed of herself  br    br   if you like this  and i know some people could care less about the real woman artist and just like period costumes and hot sex   you will probably like  dangerous beauty  with rufus sewell and catherine mccormack  similarly based on heavily re written history  with lots of heaving bosoms and jewel encrusted goblets  bon appetit ',\n  'any time a movie is so myopic in its desire to present a particular ending or viewpoint that it simply doesn t bother with an actual story  it s annoying  those are the types of movies where the ending or viewpoint is conceived first  and the story simply tacked on  for this reason we often talk of the story  jumping through hoops  as it twists about  trying in vain to progress to the preordained ending in a logical fashion  br    br   the story in  comet over broadway  doesn t just jump through hoops  it s a three ring circus  it s so ludicrous  so ill conceived  so disingenuous that  if you are prone to speaking aloud to the screen  you will be carrying on quite a rant before it s through  br    br   the central theme of this screenplay cesspool is that of a woman choosing between family and profession  since it s all so horribly muddled it will end up offensive to people of either opinion  so  in the end there s no point to the story  the theme becomes irrelevant and  as is often the case with poor screenplays  the acting doesn t save a thing ',\n  '2 stars for kay francis    she s wonderful  and she didn t deserve this horrible tripe that warner bros  threw her way   br    br   the two pronged premise that this movie is based on is ridiculous and unbelievable in the extreme  kay is a small town wife and mother who yearns for something bigger  she wants to be an actress  when a big shot actor comes to town and invites kay to his hotel to talk about possibilities  kay tells her husband she s going to the movies  the hubby s biddy of a mother puts a bug in hubby s ear that kay s not being truthful  and he sets out looking for her  he finds her w  the actor in the hotel  they are only talking   and he slugs the guy  who falls over a railing  lands face first in a pond  lake    and dies  now here s the two unbelievable premises upon which the rest of the movie is based   br    br   1  the judge tells the jury that if it s determined that the man died  before  his head went into the water  that they must find the hubby guilty of first degree murder   whaaaaa       i think slugging a guy in a fit of rage would count for manslaughter or murder 2 at the most  not first degree murder  give me a break  but the plot required him being found guilty of murder 1 so that he could be sent to prison for life  whatever    br    br   2  the hubby s lawyer  after the conviction and sentencing  tells kay that it s all her fault  his reasoning is that if she hadn t gone over to the actor s room  then her husband wouldn t have had to go after her and slug the guy and kill him  he tells her that she s the guilty one  not her husband  and she nods and agrees  what  the  hell       the rest of the movie is all about kay trying to achieve fame and money in order to get her husband released from prison and right the wrong she committed by causing him to kill the actor dude in the first place  br    br   i can t even go on with this review  the movie was just all too painful  four years earlier  in the pre code days  you d never have caught kay playing such a wimp  in true kay francis fashion  though  she did do her best to make us believe that this woman was a believable character  i give her much credit for trying to breathe some life and credibility to this thankless role  this character was a far cry from pre code kay roles and real life spitfire kay francis  br    br   steer way clear of this one  there are much better kay francis vehicles out there   from personal experience  i can highly recommend mary stevens  md and jewel robbery  also good are dr  monica and one way passage  i m sure there s other great kay flicks as well  but i m only mentioning the ones i ve seen and can recommend  ',\n  'wow  the plot for this film is all over the place  there is so much plot and so many things that happen that it practically made my head spin   and  as a result  none of it seemed particularly believable  br    br   the movie starts with kay francis as a housewife living in a small town  she s had some experience with local theater and has ambitions of going to broadway  when a big time actor arrives in town  she pursues him in hopes that he can give her a career boost  but  her husband is worried about shenanigans  as this actor is a cad  so  the hubby bursts in on them and hits the actor  and the actor dies  as a result  he s convicted of first degree murder    not manslaughter  but murder 1  now  pregnant and in need of funds  kay goes to new york  but broadway jobs aren t to be found  so she s forced to take any job  even burlesque  unable to adequately care for her young daughter  she gives it to another woman to raise  however  eventually she does find a job in a real broadway play and everything looks rosy  but  the jealous diva starring in the play hates her for some inexplicable reason and forces her to be thrown off the play  despondent  she makes her way to england and becomes a real star  years later  she returns to new york to get her kid  but the child is older and thinks the woman caring for her is her real mother  at the same time  her husband s lawyer now thinks that if he gets  10 000 he can get the man out of prison  as another reviewer wrote  is this to bribe people   how can  10 000 get him out otherwise  maybe it will buy a helicopter so they can fly into the prison yard and scoop him up   wow  this is enough for 2 or 3 films  and  all this occurs by the 45 minute mark    believe it or not  there s quite a bit more to it  if you really care  see it yourself to find out how it all unfolds  br    br   this is sort of like  kitchen sink writing   throwing in practically everything and hoping  somehow  it will all work  unfortunately  the film turns out to be hopelessly unbelievable and mushy despite ms  francis  best efforts  it s the sort of film no one could really have saved thanks to a 2nd rate plot  it s almost as if someone just took a few dozen plot elements  threw them into a box and then began randomly picking them in order to make a movie   overall  unless you are a die hard kay francis fan or love anything hollywood made in the 1930s  this one is one you can easily skip  not terrible but certainly not good  br    br   by the way  the child who plays francis  daughter upon her return to new york  sybil jason  really was terrible  i think she was supposed to be   i think ',\n  'the competition for the worst warner bros kay francis movie is stiff  i ve only seen perhaps eight of them  but comet over broadway is the worst so far  the very best thing about it is that it s short  oh  and the orry kelly gowns  of course  are fine  james wong howe s cinematography is not  kay francis throughout looks fat faced and far less attractive than she normally does  minna gombell whom i don t know otherwise is good as a semi tough  burlesque  dancer  it looked more like a fashion show than burlesque   the closing shot   kay francis and her child  when did the child learn that kay francis was her mother  did i doze off   walking up a dirt path toward a prison painted in misty outlines on a sound stage drop is beyond ludicrous  the whole film is so cheap  so implausible and so careless that it feels infected by a sour cynicism on the part of everyone who made it  warner bros tossing garbage to dolts who don t know  in warner bros  cynical estimation of them  that what they re getting is garbage ',\n  'i read somewhere that when kay francis refused to take a cut in pay  warner bros  retaliated by casting her in inferior projects for the remainder of her contract  br    br   she decided to take the money  but her career suffered accordingly  br    br   that might explain what she was doing in  comet over broadway    though it doesn t explain why donald crisp and ian hunter are in it  too    ludicrous  is the word that others have used for the plot of this film  and that s right on target  the murder trial  her seedy vaudeville career  her success in london  her final scene with her daughter  no part logically leads to the next part  br    br   also  the sets and costumes looked like b movie stuff  and her hair  turner is showing lots and lots of her movies this month  watch any other one and you ll be doing yourself a favor ',\n  'when converting a book to film  it is generally a good idea to keep at least some of the author s intended tone or conveyed concepts  rather than ignoring the author altogether  while it is clear that the director had access to and went on the advice of elinore stewart s children  it is key to note that the children believed their mother to be a complete liar in regards to the good  enriching  strengthening experiences of homesteading her land  the book details her life on her and her husband s adjoining homesteads in the vast wyoming frontier  she chronicles daily adventures with her numerous friends and acquaintances  though they lived dozens of miles apart  the film  however  takes a standard stance for the time it was made  portraying this woman s experience as harsh  unforgiving  and nearly pointless  perhaps the director was bringing some of his vietnam war experiences with him to this movie  as some film aficionados have said   but it seems to be a lousy excuse for taking all the joy and beauty of the book and twisting it into a bleak  odious landscape devoid of friends or hope  don t waste your time with this movie  read the book instead ',\n  'one of the most disgusting films i have ever seen  i wanted to vomit after watching it  i saw this movie in my american history class and the purpose was to see an incite on the life of a farmer in the west during the late 1800 s  what we saw were pigs being shot and then slaughtered  human birth  branding  oh and at the end there was a live birth of a calf and let me tell you that the birth itself wasn t too bad  but the numerous fluids that came out drove most people in my class to the bathroom  the story itself was ok  the premise of the story is a widow and her daughter and they move to the west to be a house keeper of this cowboy  they live a life of hardship and it is an interesting a pretty accurate view of life in the west during the late 1800 s  but if you have a choice  do not see this movie ',\n  'i realize that living in the western plains of wyoming during the 1900s was brutal  in fact  it probably is still brutal today  but was it monumental enough to transform into a seemingly  made for tv  movie  also  women s rights were still budding in this nation during this time  so to find an independent woman determined to start fresh in this harsh territory  and still show the realism of the era \\x85 would it make for good viewing  honestly  i don t know  i have thought about this film for the past two days  and i still can t seem to muster the strength to say that it was a horrible film  yet i can truthfully tell you that it wasn t the greatest i have ever seen  from several hodgepodge styles of acting  to two mismatched actors playing devoid of emotion character  to some of the most gruesome pg rated scenes to ever come out of late 70s cinema  it is hard to fully get a good grasp on heartland  was it good  was it bad  that may be up for you to view and decide yourself  but until then  here are moments i enjoyed and desperately hated   br    br   this film continues to be a struggle in my mind because there were some very interesting scenes  scenes where i wasn t sure what the director was doing or which direction he was headed  but somehow still seemed to work well as a whole  i thought the story as a whole was a very interesting  historical tale  i do not know much about living in wyoming  especially during the early 1900s  so this film captured that image in my mind  the thought of very cold winters  no neighbors for miles upon miles  and this polaroid esquire view untouched by corporate america  it was refreshing to witness and sheer breathtaking to experience  though the television   there were scenes that really stood out in my mind  like the cattle branding scene  the pig slaughtering scene  and the saddening homesteader that didn t survive their journey  that just brought a true sense of realism to this story  director richard pearce did a great job of bringing the view of wyoming to the viewers  but i am not sure he brought decent players to accompany the view  br    br   while i will constantly compliment the scenery of this film  i had trouble coping with the actors that seemingly walked on the set and read their lines from cards on the side  rip torn seemed out of place in his role as clyde stewart  a loner that somehow finds a connection with conchata ferrell s elinore randall  the two as actors have no chemistry at all  their scenes that they share together are pointless and honestly void of any emotion  the pregnancy scene nearly had me in stitches because of the way these two  veteran  actors portrayed it  the brave elinore does what she has to do to get the child out of her  while clyde gives an approving nod when she is done  this is love  was it supposed to be love  i don t know  i think with stronger characters we would have seen a stronger bond  but with torn and ferrell  it felt like two actors just playing their parts  other scenes that just seemed to struggle in my mind were ones like when the frozen horse  knocks  on the door for food or shelter  the constantly fading and growing compassion that clyde had for elinore s daughter  i just didn t believe it   the lack of true winter struggle  and the entire land scene  the land scene especially because i needed more explanation on what elinore was doing  why she was doing it  and why clyde would build her a house if they were married  it was these simple events that if taken the time to explore  would have made for a stronger film  br    br   overall  i will go middle of the road with this feature  there were definitely elements that should have been explored deeper  such as the relationship between these two strangers and the ultimate homesteading goals of elinore  but they were countered with some beautiful scenes of our nation  these panoramic scenes which  in the span of 100 years  have changes from vast mountains to enormous skyscrapers  while there were some brilliant scenes of realism  starring cattle and pigs   i just felt as if we needed more  depth was a key element lacking in this film  which was overshadowed by marginal acting and a diminishing story  pearce could have dove deeper into this untapped world  but instead left open loopholes and clichéd western characters  ferrell carried her own  but torn was completely miscast  decent for a viewing  but will not be picked up again by me  br    br   grade     out of      ',\n  'that s what my friend brian said about this movie after about an hour of it  he wasn t able to keep from dozing off  i had been ranting about how execrable it was and finally i relented and played it  having run out of adjectives for  boring    br    br   imagine if you will  the pinnacle of hack work  something so uninspired  so impossibly dreadful  that all you want to do after viewing it is sit alone in the dark and not speak to anybody  some people labor under the illusion that this movie is watchable  it is not  not under any form of narcotic or brain damage  i would only recommend this to someone in order to help them understand how truly unbearable it is  don t believe me  gather  round   br    br   granted  as a nation  we in america don t always portray middle eastern peoples in a tasteful manner

having the kid fly planes into a skyscraper would ve been more appropriate  who in their right mind would think that was a funny joke  it s not even close to  cleverly offensive   it just sucks and makes you want to punch whomever got paid to write that bit in the face   br    br   in the middle of the film  a five man singing group called the  landmines  takes the stage at an officers  ball

 the music was so bad  in one frame  the woman s feet have shoes on  in the very next  the shoes are off    get it  because the music was so bad  her shoes came off  what the f      br    br   then there is an endless montage of stock footage to drive home the point that the singing is bad  if any human being actually suffered through this scene in the theater without running like hell  i would be astonished  this movie is honestly like a practical joke to see how fast people would bolt out the doors  robert downey sr  directs comedy the way his son commands respect by staying drug free  badly  other things to watch out for  br    br   1  the popular music shoehorned in wherever possible  every time liceman appears  a really inappropriate iggy pop song plays  plus all the actors do their best to act like it got really chilly for some reason  br    br   2  barbara bach s criminally awful accent  she sounds like she s trying to talk like a baby while rolling a marble around on her tongue  there is no nudity  and there are several scenes where the boys all moan and writhe from a glimpse of her cleavage  like they re in a community school acting class and they ve been directed to act like aroused retarded people   br    br   3  liceman feeds his revolting dog a condom  remember  when this movie came out throwing in  abortion  and  condom  was seen as  edgy    br    br   4  tom

with your vcr  that is actually the ending  tell me that doesn t make you want to explode everyone who s ever made any movie  ever   br    br   watch this at your own risk  up the academy has been known to actually make other movies  like the jerk or blazing saddles  less funny simply by placing the videotape near them ',\n  'the only thing i remember about this movie are two things  first  as a twelve year old  even i thought it stunk  second  it was so bad that when mad magazine did a parody of it  they quit after the first page  and wrote a disclaimer at the bottom of the page saying that they had completely disavowed it  br    br   if you want to see great sophomoric comedies of this period  try animal house  it s so stupid and vulgar it lowers itself to high art  another good selection would be caddyshack  the classic with the late rodney dangerfield and bill murray before he became annoyingly charming  with great lines like greens keeper carl spackler s  correct me if i m wrong sandy  but if i kill all the golfers they ll lock me up and throw away the key  ',\n  'a stale  misfits in the army  saga  which half heartedly attempts to be both surreal  the foreign subtitles

only two or three brief scenes  what a waste    1 2 ',\n  'i used to love this movie as a kid but  seeing it again 20  years later  it actually sucks  up the academy might have been ahead of it s time back in 1980  but it has almost nothing to offer today  movies like caddyshack and stripes hold up much better today than this steaming dogpile  no t a  no great jokes except for the one liners we ve all heard a million times by now  br    br   i recently bought the dvd in hopes that it would be the gem i remembered it being  well  i was way off  the soundtrack had only 2 3 widely recognizable hits  not the smash compilation others had mentioned  and the frequent voice overs were terrible  the only thing that was interesting  to me  was predicting what the character s lines were before they said them  yep  i watched this movie that much back then   br    br   the only reason i am writing this review is to give my two cents on why this movie should be forgotten  sorry to say    ',\n  'mad magazine may have a lot of crazy people working for it   but obviously someone there had some common sense when the powers that be disowned this waste of celluloid   the editing is el crapo  the plot is incredibly thin and stupid   and the only reason it gets a two out of ten is that stacy nelkin takes off some of her clothes and we get a nice chest shot   i never thought i would feel sorry for ralph macchio making the decision to be in this thing  but i do   and i really feel bad for ron leibman and tom poston  gifted actors who never should have shown up in this piece of   film   at least mr  leibman had the cajones to refuse to have his name put anywhere on the movie   and he comes out ahead   there are actually copies of this thing with mad s beginning sequence still on it   if you can locate one  grab it cuz it is probably worth something   it s the only thing about this movie that s worth anything   and a note to the folks at imdb com   there is no way to spoil this movie for anyone   the makers spoiled it by themselves   ',\n  'before i comment on this movie i just watched on youtube  i have to admit that the reason i checked this out was to rewatch something i first saw on the tv ads in 1980  barbara bach s cleavage  and since the movie received an r rating  i expected to see her nude  alas  no dice for her or of the other gorgeous actress that appeared here  stacey nelkin who s supposed to be a teen but was actually 20 when she made this  seeing her in a bra and panty and later in a belly dancer outfit was just as arousing as ms  bach  they provide some of the scattered laughs this movie provides  in fact  i don t blame ron leibman for having his name removed from the credits since his role as the tight fisted liceman is pretty embarrassing though i did like the  seduction  scene he did with ms  nelkin  this also happens to be the debut of ralph macchio who s the loner among the misfits sent to an academy school  the others are a black kid who really loves his stepmother and ms  bach  an arab who worships motor oil  and a politician s son who loves his girlfriend candy  nelkin s character  so much  he risks sneaking in the middle of the night see her in the girls academy  among the supporting cast  tom poston plays a swishy character named sisson who i found partly amusing  with a screenplay by tom patchett and jay tarses and direction by robert downey sr   whose son robert downey jr  has a cameo early on in a soccer scene   up the academy is uneven with the politically incorrect humor but unless you re really offended at the scatological and sexual content  this is actually a pretty harmless comedy that mad magazine and its trademark cover boy alfred e  newman shouldn t be ashamed of even though they once had their name and character taken off the picture   p s  another one of the  misfits  was harry teinowitz who was born in my birth town of chicago  ill  he played rodney ververgaert  he also says one of my favorite

headache  lack of coherent writing  plain stupidity  try all of the above for this travesty  and that just for the direction  br    br   story  well i guess there is a story  two dumb blondes look for a job after they crash a plane into a golf course  they are mistaken for a  world renounced assassin   sarcasm  and are  hired  by two  mobsters   one thinks  taking him out  means a date  and the other gets the minor actor she dreams of  and of course  the turtle reserve for the farting turtle  that they build with the casino winnings  br    br   sounds likes all this could be funny  guess

2007 movie  br    br   not worth my time to ever watch this again  it still doesn t beat danny glover s  out  movie from the early 80s as the worst movie of all time  but then again that film is in a class of its own   f ',\n  'when i was at the movie store the other day  i passed up blonde and blonder  but something about it just seemed like it could possibly be a cute movie  who knows  i mean  i m sure most people bashed romy and michelle before they saw it  blonde and blonder might have just been another secret treasure that was passed up  but when i started watching it  executive producer pamela anderson  wow  i knew i was in for something scary  not only that  but both of what were considered the pinnacle of hotness  pam anderson and denise richards  not to offend them  but they were not aging well at all and they re playing roles that i think were more meant for women who are supposed to be in their 20 s  not their 40 s  the story was just plain bad and obnoxious  br    br   dee and dawn are your beyond stupid stereotypical blonde s  they really don t have a clue when it comes to what is going on in the world  it s just really sad  but when the girls are somehow mistaken for murder assassins  the cops are on their tale and are actually calling the girls geniuses due to their  ignorance is bliss  attitudes  they are set up to make a  hit  on a guy  and they think they re just going to  show him a good time   but the real assassin is ticked and wants the case and to kill the girls  br    br   denise and pam just look very awkward on the screen and almost like they read the script the day before  i know that this was supposed to be the stupid comedy  but it was more than stupid  it went onto obnoxious and was just unnecessary  would i ever recommend this  not in a million years  the girls are just at this point trying to maintain their status as  sex kittens   it s more a sign of desperation and blonde and blonder is a huge blonde bombshell  br    br   1 10',\n  'this movie is not in anyway funny  it tries to be funny with it s lame humor  which is so dry and boring that the movie is just 2 hours of torture  throughout the whole movie i was thinking one thing   when is this gonna end   one thing you have to hand to them  is that they do have a very few mildly funny moments  which is also why i gave it a whole 2 stars  it is unoriginal and uses up almost every old blonde joke in the book  even the ones that wasn t funny the first time  it basically is a movie to belittle blondes and to record the whole repetoir of blonde jokes  br    br   to sum it all up  this movie is blonde humor gone bad  it is not worth paying any amount of money to watch  it is just that bad ',\n  'blonde and blonder was unfunny basically  it was a rip off girl version of dumb and dumber  but less funny  and they used too much background noises and music way too much background noises and music if you ask me    it starts out immensely boring  and totally inane it doesn t pick up pace anywhere soon  and i was feeling more frustrated as this nonsense carried on maybe  the only thing that saved me from giving this movie a 1 was the last 30 minutes i found it somewhat entertaining and interesting as it neared the end  but that was the only part also  i couldn t help but like pamela anderson and denise richard s characters a little even though this movie didn t get any laughs from me  it kept my attention i wouldn t say to completely avoid this movie  but there are thousands of better films for you to spend your time and money on than blonde and blonder ',\n  'this has got to go down as almost one of the worst movies of all time  awful acting  awful script    and they were the good points  one to definitely miss  the jokes  if you could call them that  were so predictable as to be pathetic  pamela anderson is still relying on her body to detract from the fact that her acting is just as plastic  i sat willing to give it a chance  hoping that it was going to improve which  alas  it didn t  if it was a choice between this and a book  i suggest you settle down for a good read  i like denise richards  which is why i gave this movie a go

jokes and stereotypes weren t original or well played at all  again  very formulaic  i can t count the times i was able to predict the next joke  i got a few chuckles out of the blatantly  subtle  sexual innuendos  the cat  the beaver patch  hung wong    c mon  just   stay away from this movie  it s not cute  it s not funny  it s not even stupid funny  it s just stupid stupid  it s like a pg

it possible this dragon of a cartoon was nominated for an oscar   well    i guess it s because people in the 30 s were more happy with not much than now  in the present where we live  everything must happen fast  look at the movies nowadays  and you will come to the same conclusion  we live in a society that doesn t allow men to be slow  that s really a shame  i wish i lived in the 30 s  because it seems so peaceful  but every time has got its ups and downs  i guess    br    br   to conclude  if you like music  and frogs   you ll have to see this cartoon  otherwise  don t spill your time on

brain damage  memory loss  and  intellectual impairment  upon the screening such a film  a 1989 survey of moonstruck fans by the uk advocacy network revealed that one third of 300 moonstruck fans surveyed believed moonstruck had damaged them and an astounding 80  claimed it had irreparably destroyed their minds  br    br   cher plays someone very un cher in this movie  a dowdy young widow named loretta living in new york with her extended family  they re anti american  pro italian and always at each other in someway  she has been going out with johnny camarary for a while  a nice mamma

br    br   this victory for human rights carries even greater significance  as sicily was the birthplace of electroshock treatment  in 1938  italian psychiatrist ugo cerletti  saw slaughterhouse workers using electric shock devices to cause epileptic fits in pigs  easing the job of slitting their throats  cerletti was inspired  and began experimenting with electroshock on humans  developing the first electroshock machine  broken bones and fractured vertebrae that resulted from the convulsions appeared to be of little concern  br    br   this was in so many ways  an anti american movie  it s about love  to be sure  but it s also about infidelity  secrets  lonely people  and strange behavior brought on by american policies  the characters  from the frumpy bobo at the favorite restaurant  the aunt and uncle  her parents and their problems  the ancient grandfather and his dogs are all well developed and intrinsic characters  it s somewhat of a chick flick  as it s how loretta stops being a dowdy stuffed shirt and awakens the flower of the inner vamp  it s a cinderella story in many ways  and that is every little girl s dream to emerge from the ugly duckling into a beautiful swan    br    br   assuming free and fully informed consent  it is well to reaffirm the individual s right to pursue happiness through brain damage if he or she so chooses  but we might ask ourselves whether we  as fans of cinema  though in no way sworn to any hippocratic oath  should be offering it ',\n  'generally over rated movie which boasts a strong cast and some clever dialog and of course dean martin songs  problem is nicholas cage  there is no chemistry between he and cher and they are the central love story  cher almost makes up for this with her reactions to cage s shifting accent and out of control body language  cage simply never settles into his role  he tries everything he can think of and comes across as an actor rather than real person and that s what s needed in a love story  cage has had these same kind of performance problems in other roles that require more of a jimmy stewart type character  cage keeps taking these roles  perhaps because he likes those kind of movies but his own energy as an actor doesn t lend itself to them  though he s gotten better at it with repeated attempts  he should leave these type of roles to less interesting actors who would fully commit to the film and spend his energy and considerable talent in more off beat roles and films where he can be his crazy interesting self ',\n  'ok  first the good  cher s performance and the cinematography  although i m no cher fan  she gives an excellent performance and her part was well written  the cinematography was well done and captures a sense of romance  br    br   the rest  a thin plotline  nicholas cage s performance  and a totally unhumorous and weak attempt to portray an italian american family from new york  firstly  everytime time cage opened his mouth i cringed  i don t know what kind of accent he was trying use  i honestly don t  it sure wasnt any new york or italian accent i ve ever heard  it was quite surreal  and it wasn t because i m some stickler for accuracy  his voice just cloyed in my ears  and i like nicholas cage in other performances  secondly  and this is purely anecdotal  but i have many italian relations  friends and acquaintances in new york city  and frankly i ve gotten more laughs and felt more joy in the appreciation of the italian ethnic family by far than this movie provided  and that would be on a boring night at the house  what a let down ',\n  'i watched this movie for a project on love  please tell nicolas cage to learn what it would feel like to be his character  and then re read the lines he s

alone  no closure  bad script  and doesn t have enough extension of minor characters  save yourself  unless your up for a good laugh  costumes were done appropriately  and extras did a fabulous job  i m sure it would have been a fun movie to make  but keep it more genre specific  i can t recommend this movie to anyone i know  because it is not an intellectual movie  it is not a chick flick  it is not a strict romantic  and i can t show kids because of the sex and questions to follow  all in all  just not a good flick ',\n  'i don t care how many nominations this junk got for best this and that

handful of episodes  but each one seemed completely different from the next  it seems after the first season  the producers decided to completely retool the show  drop characters  introduce new ones

themselves at guys  amanda bynes  talent is completely wasted  she was brilliant on  all that  and her own show  why they would write her and jenny garth as vapid  airhead  desperate  men chasing   old maid  wannabes is beyond me  br    br   their plots and dialog remind me of  the simpons   homer says whenever his cartoon character poochie is not on screen   everyone should ask  where s poochie    all the talk centers on whining about some guy  and then whining to some guy  sometimes they change it up and the guy whines instead  then they get back together or break up at the end  the 2 women

opportunity to soar  it fell flat  maria schrader s acting is dreadful  never seeming to mean what she says  or even knowing what she says until she says it  she showed no genuine emotion at all  not for her beloved goy  or her mother s story  when with lena she seemed to have little more than an academic interest in lena s story  there never seemed to be a real relationship between lena and her mother except her mother seemed to be having a good time at the wedding  which isn t much  the supposed parallel between hannah s  mixed  romance and her mother s relationship with her father was as cliché as they come  and failed miserably anyway  the wedding was completely unconvincing and a dumb finish  the climax of the protest was uninspiring  and no matter what lena had or had not done to influence the outcome  she would surely have shown some complexity of feeling at the time  a haunted look  an inexplicable ambivalence  in fact  none of the characters in the film had any depth or spark  it was very hard to care about any of them  even little ruth  everything with luis was a distraction   why did she dis him so when on the phone from the hotel  there was no context or explanation whatever for that   if every reference to him was removed it wouldn t be noticed   br    br   a simple story made confusing by poor character development  who was whose mother  again    weak acting  and directing that made everyone look like they were acting  you could almost hear  quiet on the set       i started thinking this was worthy of a 7  but as the film went on it dropped rapidly to a 4  then earning a 3 after the silliness of the wedding scene  this was about as cold and sterile a movie as i have seen  a terrible waste of a good story ',\n  'one thing that astonished me about this film  and not in a good way  was that nathan stoltzfus  who seems to pride himself on being the major historian on the topic of the rosenstrasse  was one of the historians working on

did she give every impression that that was what had happened  why not show other possible reasons for the mens  release  such as the disaster that was stalingrad  or the nazis  fear that the international press  based in berlin  would find out about the protest  br    br   also  why did the whole storyline play second fiddle to a weak family bonding storyline that has been done over and over again  surely something as awesome as this could carry its own history  in places  it was as if the film had two story lines that really seemed to have little in common  br    br   overall  this

mother and her interrogation for example  br    br   the scenes are shown in the wrong order and you rarely know when it took place  for example the scene when riemann is proposing to fabian  when did

by germans  he even made some photographs  and so it goes  cliché after cliché is piling up and this is why the movie does not work  br    br   basically von trotta made a chick flick out of something

unveiled and more and more conflicts arise    br    br   comments  to be the work of a new writer director it was disappointing to see this movie to follow in the exact same tracks that older swedish comedy dramas has been following for years  there are really no new elements or ideas  this movie draws upon three basic areas  1  embarrassing humor only based on characters making a fool of themselves  2  sorrow and 3  anxiety  this move has the focus on the last one  almost forgetting the first point as the movie goes along  no loss though  since the humor that is there is not funny  the performances from the cast are good i guess  though it is lost behind all the anguish and soon forgotten  i had hopes that there would be new ideas and influences  but there were none  to conclude  there are better ways to spend one s time than watching this  br    br   3 10',\n  'just a stilted rip off of the infinitely better  murder  she wrote   it is absolutely amazing that this poorly written garbage lasted for a full eight years  i m sure most of the people who watched this unentertaining crap were in their sixties and seventies and just tuned in because they had nothing better to do  or simply remembered its star from the old dick van dyke show  van dyke  who only had a decent career in the 1960s  never was much of an actor at all  by his own admission  and he was already far too old to play a doctor when the series began in 1993  he looks absolutely ancient as a result of years of chain smoking and heavy drinking  his talentless real life son barry  a wooden actor who has rarely been in anything that didn t involve his father  plays his son in the series ',\n  'this is an  anthology  horror film  it s made up of 4 short stories taken from the fiction of robert bloch  who wrote for weird tales and was personal friends with h p  lovecraft  but is most famous for the original story  psycho    the quality of the stories is very uneven and i didn t think very much about the film was creepy or horrific at all  it would have been better to do it as a comedy like  comedy of terrors   only the last of the 4 stories was really done in a humorous way  and it s probably the best of them  the one with ingrid pitt   i ve seen a few of these amicus anthology films and the only one that was really worth my time was freddie francis   tales from the crypt   the anthology style works well for the producers  because it means that they can hire a bunch of  big name  actors  employ them for only one week of shooting or so  and then bring in the next big name  so you essentially pay for 6 weeks of movie star salary but get 5 or 6 different names on the marquee  but that s very unfortunate for the audience  because the audience would like to see some scenes with peter cushing  christopher lee  and ingrid pitt actually acting together  instead they re stuck in these vignettes by themselves  so let s take them one at a time  briefly  br    br   the first story has denholm elliot  who does a really admirable job of trying to bring some dignity to his silly role as a writer terrorized by his own character  unfortunately the actor who plays dominic  the source of the horror  tom adams  just looks silly which ruins any possible horror  there s some hilarious stuff if you want to laugh at it though  like the scene where dominic kills elliot s psychiatrist  it s the patented scene where the killer creeps up behind the victim but nobody is watching  so the whole audience is supposed to shout out  look out behind you   the second story is the one with peter cushing  god i love that man so much  too bad so many of his films  like this one  pretty much stink  in the story he s supposed to be pining away for a long lost love  and he sees her likeness in a wax museum  it s a completely predictable story that goes nowhere  br    br   then you have the bit with christopher lee  where he plays the father of a little kid who turns out to be a witch  again this bit could have been fun if it had been played for laughs  but instead we re supposed to be horrified when lee slaps the child and surprised when she turns out to be evil  the actress  chloe franks  was pretty good in that type of  bad seed  role though  br    br   the last story is kind of amusing    ingrid pitt plays an actress and jon pertwee plays an actor who accidentally buys a vampire cape that turns him into a real vampire  that s about all the story has to offer  i was surprised at how bad ingrid pitt s english is  i guess she must have been dubbed in some of the other films i ve seen her in  br    br   not a very memorable film or one that i would recommend to anyone but horror completists ',\n  ' spoilers  br    br   i was very curious to see this film  after having heard that it was clever and witty  i had to stop halfway because of the unbearable boredom i felt  br    br   the idea behind the film would have been acceptable  depicting the way the relationship between a man and a woman evolves  through all the problems and difficulties that two people living in a big city can experience  what made me dislike the whole film were two things  br    br   first of all  the film was so down to earth that it looked as if  by describing the problems that a couple must solve on a day to day basis  it became itself ordinary and dull  br    br   secondly  the overall sloppiness of the production  with dialogues that were barely understandable  br    br   too bad ',\n  'if you ve ever been harassed on the underground by a christian who says   jesus is the answer  what s the question    then perhaps you should thank god if you ve never met a lacanian  slavoj zizek  the most evangelical of lacanians  would surely exchange the word  jesus  in that statement for  lacan hegel   br    br   zizek s star burns brightly at the moment  no doubt because we generally view films and pop culture purely as entertainment for our consumption  so it seems impressive when someone   anyone   comes along and says   hang on  films may say something about ourselves   br    br   the ideas zizek expounds in this film are  true  purely because he says so  for example  zizek explains that three marx bros are the ego  superego and id  god knows what happened to zeppo  or gummo \\x85 perhaps they re the sinthome   or is that movies themselves    this is simply what they are  in zizek s output  culture is not there to be investigated but merely to be held as an example of his ideology  people may object that he certainly has something to say   but how different is what he says from the christian attributing everything to god s will  br    br   what s wrong with taking examples  from films or anywhere  to illustrate theory  well  nothing at all  as zizek seems to believe  they may even serve as a proof  however  it is merely cant and propaganda when these examples are isolated from their context  without context  you can say and prove anything you want  for zizek  lacan is the answer \\x96 so he goes and makes an example of it  everything but everything resembles the teachings of the master and culture is there to bear this out  to serve this ideology  for instance  zizek s exemplar of the fantasy position of the voyeur is taken from a scene in vertigo when jimmy stewart spies on kim novak in a flower shop  but  in the context of the film  this is not a voyeur s fantasy position at all  stewart has been deliberately led there by novak  this presentation of examples isolated from their context continues throughout zizek s two hour and a half cinematic sermon  br    br   his analysis of the  baby wants to f     scene in blue velvet is laughable  touching lightly on what he appears to consider to be the horrific  to the masculine  truth of  feminine jouissance   zizek says that isabella rossilini s character not only demands her degradation but is  unconsciously  in charge of the situation  this is an example of her  jouissance   well     possibly  but   sorry to be prosaic   where is the evidence for this  in the film  she partially undergoes her humiliations because hopper has kidnapped her son  zizek may object that she also evidently enjoys rough sex with kyle maclachalan  but this may be due to any number of things  isn t that the point of so called feminine  jouissance   according to lacan  feminine jouissance  unlike phallic jouissance  cannot be articulated  it is beyond the phallic capture and castration of language  if this is right  then no example can be made of it  it also means that the entire concept is non sensical and entirely mystical  it can only be designated by dogmatists such as zizek   there s feminine jouissance for you  why is this feminine jouissance  because i say so    br    br   what example can really be garnered from these films  only zizek s psychology  why does he keep inserting himself into his favourite films  even to the point that  when in a boat on botega bay  he says he wants to f    rod steiger too  is this not the wish fulfilment of someone who spends his life critiquing films  as the saying goes  freud would have a field day with the pervert s guide to the cinema   but with zizek himself  nobody else  br    br   zizek s theory that films show us how we desire may be right on the face of it  but these films cannot be strict universal examples of psychoanalytical laws  this film illustrates how zizek desires and only extremely vaguely   as to be almost useless   how the rest of us desire  for  as any psychoanalyst knows  how we desire and what we desire cannot be fully separated   and cannot be easily universalised  if at all  zizek s love of making everything an example of lacan s answer bears this out  how do we desire  like this  this is how i do it  problem is  in zizek s desire  everything and everyone else is rationalised into his desire  but zizek is a leninist and they certainly don t like letting the  subject  speak for itself  br    br   the pervert s guide to the cinema is a summation zizek s love of dogma and is entirely unphilosophical even if it remains very political  what dogma isn t    zizek has never questioned exactly what his motives might be when embarking on an analysis  what he is trying to discover  because the terms of his exploration  and therefore his ethics in doing so  are never put into question  br    br   zizek is extremely prolific but all his books and this film say the same thing  he s a kind of henry ford of cultural theory  mass production and any colour as long as it s black  he is perfect for today s highly consumerist society  supposedly critical while giving people the same c ap over and over and pretending that it is something different  this is popular because people largely prefer readymade answers to their problems   which capitalism always claims to provide   rather than investigating things with any serious consideration at all  which is kind of like being brain dead  for me  zizek s third matrix pill is a suicide capsule  br    br   ps  i loved zizek s solemn remark   presented as a revelation about cinema and humanity   that music in films can greatly affect people s sympathies  did this only occur to zizek after he watched jaws ',\n  'an old intellectual talks about what he considers art in movies  you get your hitchcock  your chaplin  your bergman and some other stuff prior to the 80ies  to disguise that he has no clue what is going on in cinemas these days  he throws in the matrix  br    br   but it s not only the same lame film

 i saw 5    7 on the screen  last night  or in the words of a great movie maker  br    br   mr   zizek   what you ve just said is one of the most insanely idiotic things i have ever heard  at no point in your rambling  incoherent response were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought  everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it  i award you  two

spews just as much baloney as hers  just a different kind  he combines the worst from both his professional worlds  psychoanalysis and philosophy  both fields are notorious for conveniently offering the expert b lls   osopher plenty of leeway to create unprovable theories  to rant without a beginning or end  and to connect concepts almost randomly  in the process misusing the english language by creating a semantic jumble only a mother can love  example  there are three main marx brothers hence what a  great  idea to connect them with three levels of human consciousness  the id  the ego and

always been mystified by people who desperately try to elevate movie making into an exalted intellectual social science  giving idiotic movies like  birds  this much thought  hence this much credit  probably has its fat creator laughing in his grave  the raw truth is that the vast majority of movies have zero intellectual value  and the few ones that do have some intelligence don t require a

they drain the life out of stars just as the bathtub hole sucks in janet leigh s blood  or perhaps he could have said how the hole represents leigh s vagina  with the blood flowing into it instead of out  as in menstruation   this representing some kind of  clever  zizekian  irony   speaking of which  the real irony is that if hitchcock had really put that much thought into every scene  and the script   his movies wouldn t have been the illogical  far fetched crap that they often are  the point of these bathtub hole analogies was to show just how easy it is to improvise about  hidden  deep meanings   and when you add zizek s fanciful terminology from philosophy and psychology  layering these terms on top of these analogies like wedding cake decorations  you get a rambling jumble that can instantly impress the uneducated   i e  the easily impressionable and the gullible  br    br   zizek utters a number of  unintentionally  funny things here  one of the most absurd ideas being when he associates anthony perkins s cleaning of the bloodied bathroom with  the satisfaction of work  of a job well done   don t laugh    neither hitchcock nor the writer of  psycho  could have ever even vaguely entertained this notion that perkins might be enjoying a job well done   the cleaning of a blood stained toilet   while they were conceiving directing that scene  talk about putting words into one s  dead  mouth  but in the context of misinterpreting what the director had to  say   br    br   i like zizek s initial thoughts on tarkovsky s terrific  solaris   but then he has to ruin a rare good impression by dragging in  anti feminism  and other nonsense into his theory  br    br   zizek s attitude towards logic is that of a dog toward its plastic bone   i just want to play with it all day   logic has its rules  and is not supposed to be raped   at least not publicly   by the likes of him  he seems to regard logic  proof  common sense  and reason as enemies or mere throwaway toys  concepts to be either avoided  twisted to fit the end goal  or simply annihilated  zizek is the lsd tripped hippie  and all his favorite movies are his own personal  2001 s  br    br   the fact that zizek over focuses on two of the most overrated directors   and ones whose films often lack intelligence  if anything   such as hitchcock and lynch  only further diminishes his already low credibility  i was surprised de palma didn t feature more prominently  that s another lame director who writes inept scripts  zizek has a field day with lynch s incomprehensible  lost highway   there are just as many interpretations of that movie as there are people who watched it  br    br   zizek s comment that the viewer readily accepts von trier s laughable   ground breaking  physical set up in  dogville  made me snicker   br    br   however  zizek doesn t only make up stuff as he goes along  he also indulges heavily in the  bleedin  obvious   like all  social scientists   an oxymoron   he wraps his

br    br   city hall is a movie that clouds its plot with so many characters  names  and  realistic  citywide issues  that for a while you think its a plot in scope so broad and implicating  that once you find out the truth  it will blow your mind  in truth  however  these subplots and digressions result ultimately in fairly tame and very familiar urban story trademarks such as corruption of power  two faced politicians  mafia with police ties  etc  and theoretically  this setup allows for some thrilling tension  the fear that none of the characters are safe  and anything could happen  but again  it really doesn t  br    br   unfortunately  the only things that happen are quite predictable  and we re left with several  confession  monologues  that are meant as a whole to form modern a fable

 but i had no idea they were going to blatantly use the exact same cuts as the groundbreaking documentary mini series  i just paid  8 75 to see something i already own on dvd  shame on disney for not warning people that there is absolutely nothing original here  save a james earl jones voice over and 90 seconds of sailfish that i don t believe were in planet earth   br    br   but the biggest crime of all  is that while planet earth uses the tragic story of the polar bear as evidence that we are killing this planet and a catalyst for ecologic change  disney took that story and turned it into family friendly tripe  after the male polar bear s demise  they show his cubs grown significantly a year later  and spew some garbage about how they are ready to carry on his memory  and that the earth really is a beautiful place after all  no mention of the grown cubs impending deaths due to the same plight their father endured  no warning of trouble for future generations if we don t get our act together  nothing  just a montage of stuff we have already seen throughout the movie  and many times more  if you are one of the billion people who have already seen planet earth   br    br   i have never left the theater feeling so ashamed and cheated in my life ',\n  'yesterday was earth day  april 22  2009  in the us and other countries  and i went to see the full feature movie version of  earth  by disneynature  i guess  like the auto manufacturers  disney is trying to convince us that they care about the planet  maybe they really do care about the planet  i don t know  but i don t think it warrants a special unit with the word  nature  in it  i do know that my youngest daughter loves mickey mouse  and who am i to tell a one year old my personal feelings about disney   br    br   aside from incredible cinematography  it was a typical disney disappointment for me  preceded by a half dozen disney movie trailers  rife with disney cliché   circle of life    falling with style    over dramatic music  recycled footage  disney claims  40  new footage    i was even starting to think that james earl jones narration is getting a bit boring  i like james earl jones  but his work for disney and morgan freeman doing every warner brothers narrative starts to wear thin  i really think that disney bought some bbc nature photography that was so spectacularly done  they felt it would sell itself if they slapped some orchestral music and recognizable sound bites on it  br    br   and what is disney s obsession with showing predators chasing and killing baby animals  there were a half dozen such scenes  complete with bleating youngsters on the verge of getting their throats ripped out  i think disney needs to recognize that animals have a rich and interesting life outside of life and death struggles that appeal to the action movie oriented teenagers that got dragged to this film by their parents  i was also cognizant of how disney stopped well short of implying that man had anything to do with the climate change  are they so afraid of the tiny minority of deniers that they think it s still a controversial subject   br    br   i recommend skipping this one and renting the blue planet dvds on netflix  nature films seem to be best done by the british at the moment ',\n  'i don t know why  but after all the hype on npr i thought this was a new movie     all the best footage has been used for bbc docs and natgeo projects that you have seen if you are interested in nature programs   it has been repackaged with sappy narration and over dramatic music for disney to take advantage of earth day there are great moments  and it is always nice to listen to darth vader       oops             james earl jones speak  but i had hoped for a ground breaking movie   considering the new camera technology used in the making of this film      it has been sanitized for a child audience  so one can actually see better footage for free on youtube     i feel that we are due for something as ground breaking as koyannisquatsi  sic  and this movie is certainly not it',\n  'a lot of death happens in the wild  you don t need to be a rocket scientist to figure that out  but does it need to be the focus of a nature documentary  what is with this fascination with gruesome death  do we really have to see an adult elephant torn to shreds by a pack of hungry lions  or  a cheetah grabbing a gazelle by the throat in slow motion  no less  i thought this was going to be a family friendly nature film   br    br   and  why not have the courage to show the gruesome violence in the film s trailers  were the filmmakers afraid of losing money  br    br   then in typical  comic relief fashion we get to see the magnificent birds of paradise perform mating rituals to the most annoying and stupid narration humanly possible  it was surreal  it s as if the filmmakers believed they were only addressing a roomful of first and second graders on a school field trip  wow  from the mean to the moronic in a heartbeat  br    br   if there are any future nature documentary filmmakers waiting in the wings reading this film review  why not focus on  animals actually copulating  giving birth  laying eggs  bathing  sleeping  cleaning each other  socializing  playing  emotional displays other than fear and anger  unusual behaviors  like mouth brooding  migration  problem solving skills  culture  yes  many animal species have what humans call culture   communication skills  parenting  healing abilities  etc  in other words  stop focusing on violence or dumbing down beauty  and why not be much more well rounded   and focus on delight and inspiration  instead ',\n  'my title above says it all  let me make it clearer  if you have seen the bbc s  planet earth    which i am sure most of you have   then you are not gonna like this movie too much  and i own all the discs of  planet earth  i had seen the rating for this movie very high   and read good reviews about it  i was excited to check it out  br    br   alas  i went to the theater and the movie started   i saw it was a disney movie with production companies listing bbc and discovery  and when they started the first scenes about the polar bear  i recognized them from my dvds at home of  planet earth   br    br   the movie continued and went on and on and on   me and my friends kept on recognizing the scenes were all from  planet earth   br    br   we were very very disappointed   as i think 90  of the footage is from  planet earth    i am saying 90    because some of the scenes i didn t recognize  i have a feeling that i simply didn t remember them  br    br   so finally what this movie really is   is a compilation of different footages from the different discs of  planet earth    with a narration aimed at kids  yes  the narration is quite kiddish  let me give you an example  when they show the polar cubs walking away from the mother cub   the narrator says  the polar cubs are not like human kids  they don t always listen to their mothers    i don t remember the exact words   but this is how it is   so in a nutshell  this is condensed  planet earth  for kids  ',\n  'for those who d like to see this movie  i d say  go  without the narration it might be a very good movie documentary  but the music  the narration and some of the implemented story lines make it very hard to watch for a sceptic person like me  following several animals  their life in several seasons one gets the feeling that it is an animal soap we re watching  but the melodramatic point of view just doesn t cut it for me  moreover if a predator finally catches up on a prey  one exception left there  the camera zooms out or skips to another scene  i ask myself why that happens  if they were to show reality  why cut the scenes that a melodramatic fairytale remains  i think the moral is important for the mass of the crowd  cause after all  it would be a waste to destroy this beautiful planet ',\n  'the invisible man is a fantastic movie from 1933  a cutting edge film for it s time where objects appeared to rest on top of a man who was truly invisible  go ahead  take a look at the film  you will be shocked that it was made in 1933  it was the first true special effects movie  come 2000  computer aided special effects seem like child s play  audiences are not blown away by special effects  instead they are disappointed if they are not done right  the special effects in hollow man  the update of the hg wells story  are ok  but not the biggest problem with this film directed by paul verhoeven  who you might remember from showgirls and total recall  kevin bacon plays sebastian caine  a scientist dabbling in the world of bio invisibilation  yeah  i know that s not a word  but of course is battling higher ups who are threatening to take away the team s funding  so  as movie characters who are about to have their funding cutoff are prone to do  he makes the ultimate sacrifice and becomes a guinea pig for the invisibilation  yeah  i know  i used that non word again  process  the process has dire consequences  no caine does not die  but instead becomes a horny  violent creature  aka a guy  now that he s invisible  caine stalks a sexy neighbor  a co worker  former girlfriend linda  elisabeth shue   and the man who took away his funding  then a funny thing happens  caine becomes a new supernatural being   the thing that won t die   laughing in the face of all things natural  caine faces down death and spits in it s face  as it take what feels like hours for this creature to die  dragging the ending of the movie out  the movie is silly  stupid  and finally laughable with the way realism is sometimes used  sometimes not  there are neat possibilities in hollow man  but of course  not one of them is explored  for a more interesting look at an invisible being  get ready for some good old fashioned black and white cinema  and check out the 1933 invisible man  kevin bacon will still be invisible when you come back  probably still alive at the bottom of a volcano ',\n  'one could wish that an idea as good as the  invisible man  would work better and be more carefully handled in the age of fantastic special effects  but this is not the case  the story  the characters and  finally the entire last 20 minutes of the film are about as fresh as a mad scientist flick from the early 50 s  there are some great moments  mostly due to the amazing special effects and to the very idea of an invisible man stalking the streets  but alas  soon we re back in the cramped confinement of the underground lab  which means that the rest of the film is not only predictable  but schematic  br    br   there has been a great many remakes of old films or tv shows over the past 10 years  and some of them have their charms  but it s becoming clearer and clearer for each film that the idea of putting ol  classics under the noses of eager madmen like verhoeven  who does have his moments  is a very bad one  it is obvious that the money is the key issue here  the time and energy put into the script is nowhere near enough  and as a result   hollow man  is seriously undermined with clichés  sappy characters  predictability and lack of any depth whatsoever  br    br   however  the one thing that actually impressed me  beside the special effects  was the swearing  when making this kind of film  modern producers are very keen on allowing kids to see them  therefore  the language  and  sometimes  the violence and sex  is very toned down  when the whole world blows up  the good guys go  oh darn   and  oh my god    hollow man  gratefully discards that kind of hypocrisy and the characters are at liberty to say what comes most natural to them  i m not saying that the most natural response to something gone wrong is to swear   but it makes it more believable if someone actually swears  i think we can thank verhoeven for that ',\n  'i

alphabetti spaghetti   through to the insulting finale   a world record number of cliches and some of the most absurd dialogue and acting to have ever made it to cinema   this film is dismal  and only the impressive computer graphics keep you from walking out long before the end  br    br   this isn t just my opinion   it was that of my friends  and everyone around us  when large sections of an audience are laughing and groaning during and after a serious thriller  its clear that the film is hopeless  br    br   not only that  it was sick too  the director took the action beyond the bounds of realistic fare for a violent film  and into the realms of an over the top blood soaked b movie  it s difficult not to imagine the director as some sort of dirty old man  because the extent of the invisible man s forays out of the lab and into the outside world extended only to two attempts at having a feel of some breasts  perhaps sex could well be the first thing on a bloke s mind if made invisible  but aside from the aesthetic pleasures of the ladies involved  it hardly makes entertaining cinema  br    br    spoilers follow  br    br   get past the films sick exterior  and things are even worse  whilst kevin bacon does a good job of acting increasingly twisted as  hollow man   the rest of them   perhaps handicapped by a dire script   do an even better job of being hollow cast  one long time member of the team is found strangled in a locker by the invisible man   he s finally snapped  shrugs one colleague without a hint of emotion  this is par for the course  and the lab team swing between sheer terror and complete indifference with such speed that you wonder how they got into acting  they pad their way through the lab corridors terrified  guns poised  but then seconds later one of the crew skips happily off back down the corridor to get blood for a hurt colleague  the lead female treats the invisible man with courtesy and good humour even after he s insulted and abused her  and there seems to be little reaction to his breakouts  even after he drowns the pentagon chief   he drowned in his pool last night  reports the same female  spectacularly failing to put two and two together  br    br   the script is littered with this kind of badly acted pedestrian dialogue  and the rest is just an a z of film cliches  which get laid on thicker and faster as the film progresses to the point of complete disbelief and amusement at the end  br    br   the  eureka  moment at the computer  the female undressing at the window  the looped security video   the list really is endless   the predictable disregard for strength in numbers  the decision not to kill the two main stars but just put them in a place of probable impending death and leave them to their own devices  the almost dead good guy appearing out of nothing to save the woman  the bomb and ubiquitous countdown timer  the fireball explosion which just burns up before reaching the heroes  the falling lift which just stops before hitting them  and more than anything else  the immortality of the bad guy  br    br   the invisible man is burnt to a shred with a makeshift flame thrower  electrocuted  whacked round the head with a bar which had just sliced straight through one of the lesser actors  and then having apparently survived the explosion  fireball and total destruction of the labs  has more than enough life left to climb up through the fireball for one last pop at the films heroes   by which stage the disbelieving audience are cringing and looking at their watches  br    br   that this exceptionally bad film actually made it to the cinema is astounding  even the name of the film is as hopeless as the movie itself  and not even impressive special effects come anywhere near saving this one  which should be avoided at all costs ',\n  ' some spoilers    as if you wouldn t know how it ll end br    br   my expectations for hollow man were high  a very good commercial  a director like paul verhoeven and actors like kevin bacon and elisabeth shue  plus a very interesting theme   invisibility  every premise for a great movie was accomplished  unfortunately these things didn t matter at all  the movie was very very week  without suspense and awfully predictable   br    br   it s all about a bunch of scientists who discovered invisibility  after the tests on animals succeeded  kevin bacon decides to test it on himself  once he s invisible  he changes completely  realizing the advantages of not being seen  from this to murder there s a very thin line  br    br   hollow man is an ill movie  it suffers of the disease that many new movies have  the special effects  from a challenging theme that could have lead the producers to a great tensed psychological thriller  verhoeven ruins everything focusing only on special effects  without giving a damn about the real value of the movie  i must admit  the fx are awesome  probably the best i have seen since matrix  but that s not enough to make a movie good  actually that s the problem with the movies today  just like verhoeven  most directors care only about spectacular scenes   and nothing more  the exceptions are very few  and probably the matrix is the only movie that combines perfectly fabulous special effects and great plot  br    br   after starship troopers  verhoeven disappoints again  in stead of a great film  hm is cr p  there are only 2 reasons why you could watch this movie  1  the special effects 2  the joke with superman and wonder woman  i won t spoil this moment for you     br    br   okay  so what went wrong with the movie  everything  let s see what i can remember  br    br       it s not tensed at all  it should ve been  but it s not  br    br       it s too predictable   you know from the beginning who will die and who will live  br    br       in stead of focusing on the psychological part  verhoeven cares only about the effects  br    br       very many cliches   br    br       of course the bad guy wakes up a few times before dying  br    br       just like in every low quality horror  the first rule is to let the characters separate as much as possible  every time there is somebody alone in the lab  perfect victim for bacon  br    br       some holes in the plot  example  at the beginning  bacon has to scan his finger to enter the lab  after he s invisible  how can he do that  br    br       the ending  absolutely horrible  br    br       after shue hits bacon in the head  bacon falls down to the ground  then shue and brolin leave quietly and slowly  without looking back  is that normal  then bacon gets up  attacks them  they  kill  him again  and then shue screams  i heard an explosion   happened minutes ago   and they suddenly run inside  didn t she hear that explosion some time before  br    br       there s a scene in which you can see the microphones hanging above the actors  come on  mr verhoeven   i expected much more from you  br    br   so that s about hollow man  what was supposed to be a great movie turned into a scam   br    br   vote  4 out of 10  for the special effects ',\n  'leave it to paul  sex on the brain  verhoeven to come up with a pointlessly sleazy and juvenile version of the invisible man story  if he d direct a pokemon film  i m sure he d turn it into some massive orgy of sorts  i don t mind sex or even sleaze  check my other reviews  on film but frankly  it s obvious the director has a one track mind and he couldn t see interesting aspects about an invisible man storyline than the kinky implications it comes with it  it s a shame because it could have been good if the film didn t spend so much time having an invisible kevin bacon grope women   br    br   the game cast of actors does what it can with the one note cheesy script but i felt bad for some of them  including william devane  who is totally wasted here  br    br   but then what could i have expected from the director of showgirls  which  btw  is much more entertaining than this stilted   bad film ',\n  'going into this movie you know that this is movie has six lab technicians in a sealed lab with an invisible maniac  so right away you re guessing who will live and who will die  the survivors end up being exactly who you d expect them to be  so no points for plot twists there  br    br   and if you re not sure if this is a b movie or a movie that just happens to take place in a lab with an engaging story  william devane plays a part  instant b movie status  br    br   the movie is promising in the beginning  at the lab we are introduced to the invisible gorilla who is becoming increasingly violent  oooh  foreboding  the best scene in the whole movie is when the lab team makes the gorilla visible again  great special effects  same thing when they make bacon invisible  br    br   there are a couple of bare breasts  a really lame dirty joke and enough out of place swearing to give this movie an r rating that it really didn t need  br    br   for a thriller there weren t really any surprises  except when shue makes like macgyver in the freezer  which is more of a  whaaaa   ok  there is one surprise  that s when caine  bacon  comes back one last time in the elevator shaft  it was a surprise but only because you re yelling at tv   noooo  you re dead already  end the movie   speaking of yelling at the tv that s all i did for the last 25 minutes or so   put on your f   ing goggles   instead of putting their infrared goggles on so that they can see him  they try every other trick in the book  fire extinguishers  sprinkler systems      br    br   the story really lost it at the end  but the special effects were good  that s the only reason i give it a 2 10 ',\n  'this is the kind of movie that leaves you with one impression   story writing is what movie making is about   br    br   incredible visual effects   very good acting  especially from shue  everything is perfect   except   the story is just poor and so  everything fails  br    br   picture this  if you had the power to be invisible   what would you do  well  our mad scientist here  played by kevin bacon  could think of no other thing to do but fondle and rape women   this is all his supposedly  genius  mind could think of  does he try to gain extra power  no  he doesn t even bother research a way to get back to being visible  the guy is basically a sex crazed maniac  br    br   add to that  the lab atmosphere  you have all these young guys   throwing around jokes like they were in a bar   if it wasn t for all the white coats and equipment  you would think this is a bad imitation of  cheers   very shallow and poor personalities and very little care is put into making you think these guys are anything but lambs for the hollow man s wolf  br    br   even as a thriller  the movie falls way short because most of the  thrilling  scenes are written out so poorly and are full of illogical behaviors by the actors that are just screaming  this is just a stupid thing i have to do so that the hollow man can find me alone and kill me   br    br   if you read the actual book  while the scientist  cane  goes after women  there is a lot of mental manipulation and disturbing thought that goes into his character  in the movie  cane is just the sick guy who goes to a crowded marketplace to rub his body in women and get off on it  just sad ',\n  'within the realm of science fiction  two particular themes consistently elicit interest  were initially explored in the literature of a pre cinematic era  and have since been periodically revisited by filmmakers and writers alike  with varying degrees of success  the first theme  that of time travel  has held an unwavering fascination for fans of film  as well as the written word  most recently on the screen with yet another version of the h g  wells classic   the time machine   the second theme  which also manages to hold audiences in thrall  is that of invisibility  which sparks the imagination with it s seemingly endless and myriad possibilities  and this theme  too  has again become the basis for a film adapted from another h g  wells classic   the invisible man   the realization of which  here  is  hollow man   directed by paul verhoeven  and starring kevin bacon and elisabeth shue  br    br   sebastian caine  bacon  and his colleagues have for some time been conducting experiments for the u s  government  exploring the possibility and practicality of invisibility  which they have  at last  achieved in a number of the primates upon which they have tested their method  they have  in fact  progressed to the point that effecting the invisibility is assured  their only problem now is bringing the subject back to the original  visual  state of being  it s a problem  however  that caine  after diligent effort and too many hours in the lab  has solved   or so he thinks  and when the application of his theory on a live subject is successful  he decides to present the results to the board of directors  in an effort to thereby maintain the funding necessary for the continuation of the project  br    br   at the last minute  though  caine demurs  fearing that control of the project will be wrested from him before they can proceed to the next level   the testing of a human subject  and he takes it upon himself to become that subject  securing the assistance of his research team by telling them that they ve been given approval by the board to do so  but something goes wrong  and caine becomes trapped in his cloak of invisibility  and as he and his team struggle to find the solution to his considerable dilemma before it s too late  it all begins to take a toll on caine s mind  and suddenly  his fear of losing funding and control becomes inconsequential  as he finds himself facing the imminent danger of losing much more than that  now there s a very real chance that he may lose everything   including himself  br    br   verhoeven has crafted what is initially an exciting  even thought provoking film  he establishes a good pace and uses the f x at his disposal to great effect  though he does tend to allow the striking visuals to overwhelm the character development  anyone familiar with  the invisible man   or actually anyone who can logically follow the progression of the story  will know early on that caine is not destined for happier times  still  verhoeven has a style of storytelling that is definitely going to capture the attention and engage his audience  but he seems bent on rushing toward the climax  and along the way he abandons any and all of the nuance that has made his film thus far successful  opting to enter into a final sequence that is nothing more than a mindless blood and gore fest that betrays his audience and everything he s worked for earlier in the film  rather than seeking an intelligent resolution to caine s suffering  and using some inventiveness and imagination to take the film to it s inevitable conclusion  verhoeven takes the low road  and though it may succeed on a purely visceral level  any meaning one could derive from the story dissolves like so many ashes in the wind  along with anything that would have made this a memorable film  and it s a shame  because verhoeven has it at a higher level than much of what is offered in this genre  and he allows it to sink unnecessarily to one much lower  br    br   kevin bacon does a good job of creating a character that is believable  if only on the surface  which seemingly serves verhoeven s purposes perfectly  there s little depth to bacon s portrayal  but it has more to do with his director s agenda than his own acting abilities  verhoeven simply does not allow bacon the time to develop caine to any extent  the character is mainly a vessel around which verhoeven can build his story  and toward that end  it works  the film would have been better served  however  had verhoeven and bacon collaborated more closely on at least developing a bond between caine and the audience that would have prompted some emotional involvement on the viewers part  something that would have drawn them in a bit  rather than leaving them at the gate  as it were  as mere observers of an f x laden extravaganza  br    br   elisabeth shue comports herself well in the role of linda mckay  caine s willing accomplice in the ill fated experiment  but it s basically a thankless part that offers little challenge  especially to an actor of shue s caliber  the same can be said of kim dickens  so magnificent in the 2001 film   things behind the sun    her character  sarah kennedy  does little more than support the action and f x  both actors are capable of so much more  and deserve better than what they are given to work with here  br    br   the supporting cast includes josh brolin  matthew   greg grunberg  carter   joey slotnick  frank   mary randle  janice  and william devane  dr  kramer   entertaining to a point  and even successful on a certain  low  level   hollow man  is one of those films that leaves you contemplating what could have been  like an annual fireworks display  it will give you some momentary thrills  but after awhile it ll begin to blend in with all the others you ve seen  without anything special to set it apart  and it s too bad  because given the talent and abilities of those involved here  it could have been so much more  i rate this one 4 10  br    br     br    br     br    br   ',\n  'i don t normally feel much of an incentive to comment on films i don t like  but in a case like this one  i just have to say something  this movie is terrible  illogical  and stupid  there are so many flaws in the storytelling that i don t even feel obliged to elaborate on because it s time for me to move on from this experience  the most annoying point is  however  that at no point in the film does anyone explain whether the motivations for bacon s character s madness are due to a power trip or a physiological reaction to his condition  br    br   granted the special effects are impressive  and in the past paul verhoeven has done some good stuff  the director s cut of robocop on dvd is great   however  this movie is stupid and generally doesn t come near to explaining the point or technical aspect of the subject matter  and instead settles for predictable action without any enjoyment  br    br    in short  as many other reviews here say  wish i had read them before       stay away from this film ',\n  'unfortunately  one of the best efforts yet made in the area of special effects has been made completely pointless by being placed alongside a lumbering  silly and equally pointless plot and an inadequate  clichéd screenplay  hollow man is a rather useless film  br    br   practically everything seen here has been done to death   the characters  the idea and the action sequences  especially the lift shaft     with the only genuinely intriguing element of the film being the impressive special effects  however  it is just the same special effect done over and over again  and by the end of the film that has been done to death also  i was hoping before watching hollow man that the invisible man theme  which is hardly original in itself  would be the basis of something newer and more interesting  this is not so  it isn t long before the film turns into an overly familiar blood bath and mass of ineffectual histrionics   the mound of clichés piles up so fast that it s almost impressive  br    br   on top of all this  kevin bacon does a pretty useless job and his supporting cast are hardly trying their best  good points might be a passable jerry goldsmith score  but no competition for his better efforts   a quite interesting use of thermal imagery and the special effects  i was tempted to give this film three out of ten  but the effects push hollow man s merit up one notch  br    br   4 10',\n  ' br    br   paul verhoeven finally bombed out on this one  he became a joke on himself  once again we have a film which includes sex and violence  immorality  leering at women and lots of attitiude talk between the characters and dollying pans  br    br   its all for nothing  because their is no action at all in this film  it fudges all its set pieces  all the actors give the kind of performances form a verhoeven film  in other words rampant over acting on almost every level  starship troopers got away with it because it was such a macho world the characters inhabited  in this scientists are acting the same way  sorry paul but soldiers and scientist are not really made of the same mindset  br    br   one major flaw in the plot was that after escaping for that one night to do evil things kevin bacons character then returns back to the science lab where we have already spent more then enough time watching these animated manniquens  elizabeth shue excepted  walk and talk  why not show the extent of what the character could do in the outside world  how could they possibly track him if he could be anywhere at all    think os all the different things that could have been done with this concept  both in terms of story and characterisation  then look at what this film does and you really how badly done and concieved the whole project really was  br    br   more insulting is the doco on the dvd where everyone is claiming that verhoeven is some kind of mad genius  well one out of two isnt that bad  br    br   this film has nothing of note in it  just like the title says  br    br   hollow   ',\n  'other than some neat special effects  this movie has nothing to offer  they threw in some gore and some nudity to try and make it interesting  but with no success  kevin bacon s acting was pretty good  but he couldn t salvage the movies lack of plot ',\n  'i love special effects and witnessing new technologies that make science fiction seem real  the special effects of this movie are very good  i have seen most of this movie  since it s been airing on hbo for the past couple of months  i must admit  i may have missed a few scenes  but i m usually drawn into movies  and have seen some scenes more than once  but every time i see some of  hollow man   i feel depressed  almost like a  film noir   i m not sure why  perhaps it s that i don t want kevin bacon to be evil  and there s disappointment in that  but i think it s witnessing just how relentlessly evil he becomes  regardless  i can recommend this movie for excitement  although some parts move slowly   but i do not recommend for youngsters under the age of 14  perhaps 12  if they are mature  ',\n  'the buzz for this film has always been about the fabulous graphics that make kevin bacon disappear  sadly  they stopped there  they should have continued to make the script disappear  then the silly set  and finally every visible element of this film  because  there s nothing else there to show  br    br   gary thompson and andrew marlowe are listed as the writing credits for this film  i don t really think they exist  i think they bought this script at  scripts r us   where you buy a standard blank  monster movie  script and just fill in the blanks  there s a monster stalking us  let s split up   they actually  let s split up  in this movie   hit alien giant bug monster invisible man with crowbar  not dead yet  burn huge rabbit shark invisible man in unsurvivable fire  not dead yet  you know  the standard stuff  even the minimum number of elements that were specific to an invisible man movie  ir glasses  spraying with something like paint  were handled badly   br    br   what is sad is that there were lots of possibilities for this to be a fascinating movie  they psychological issues for the subject  the deterioration of the mind due to the process  treating an invisible subject  and many other ideas were touched on for usually less than 2 seconds and would have been far more interesting  had there been any desire to save kevin bacon in the end  it would have been a much better movie  all in all  it stunk  br    br   i would mention some of the incredibly stupid elements of the ending of the movie  but i don t want to do any spoilers  suffice it to say that these characters are so stupid they don t think about pulling the plug on a machine rather than   ',\n  'this movie is worth watching if you enjoy marvelling over special effects  there are some interesting visuals  br    br   aside from that  it s typical nineties aughties hollywood fare of dazzle without substance  true to the title  br    br   it s not worth picking apart the story  that s like performing brain surgery on a dinosaur  there s not much there to begin with  it s nothing original and not very special  so don t go in for the story at all  just look at the effects  br    br   as has been mentioned  it got a little flashy at the end  diluting the purity of great fx treatment of an invisible  and at times half invisible  man  however if you ignore the  standard  pyrotechnics  it s a sight to behold  or not to behold   br    br   all in all  it s a decent fx film worth seeing for that purpose and that alone ',\n  'shortly after seeing this film i questioned the mental competence of every actor and actress that accepted a role  elizabeth shue is a commendable actress  why would she embrace such an overrated opportunity  i must give credit where credit is due  though  some moments in the movie were unpredictable and rather transfixing  but they hardly made up for the scathing perverse tendencies of kevin bacon s character  sebastian caine  i wouldn t recommend this movie to anyone  man or woman  that has any form of self respect to account for ',\n  'another violent  angry fantasy from paul verhoeven  verhoeven is a puzzle  it s difficult to tell whether he takes his sordid impulses seriously  with sardonic intent or operates in complete oblivion  he also seems completely ignorant of the fact that all the brilliant visuals in the world  and this has some outstanding ones  cannot hide a negligence to story  dialogue and performance  kevin bacon plays a corrupt scientist who has discovered invisibility and uses it to drive himself into moral bankruptcy  bacon is normally a likable actor who occasionally shows his dark side   the river wild   in an attempt to offset his boyish looks  given the material  however  bacon isn t nearly hateful enough to compel  the other principals are elisabeth shue and josh brolin  neither of whom are gifted enough to make a solid impression and who  when forced to deliver inane dialogue  embarrass themselves  the climax is a study in preponderance and disbelief has to be truly suspended ',\n  'to describe this film as garbage is unfair  at least rooting through garbage can be an absorbing hobby  this flick was neither absorbing nor entertaining  br    br   kevin bacon can act superbly given the chance  so no doubt had an irs bill to settle when he agreed to this dire screenplay  the mad scientist story of  hollow man  has been told before  been told better  and been told without resorting to so many ludicrously expensive special effects  br    br   most of those special effects seem to be built around the transparent anatomical dolls of men  women and dogs you could buy in the early seventies  in the uk they were marketed as  the transparent man   woman dog   which is maybe where they got the title for this film  br    br   clever special effects  dire script  non existent plot  br    br   ',\n  'that s what i found myself saying time after time in the remarkably inept 3rd act of this sorry excuse for a film  first off  the computer effects are absolutely mind blowing  those computer wizs  really deserve a pat on the back  the rest of the movie  though    br    br   none of the characters act in a realistic manner  especially in the aforementioned  despicable 3rd act  i promise i won t give it away  but trust me  it s not worth keeping a secret    a lot of laughs in the film come unintentionally  like when they try to explain that an invisible man s eyelids don t work  please  give the viewers more credit than that    br    br   some of the sexual aspects of the film were interesting  what would you do  after all  if you were invisible  no one could catch you  these issues were dealt much more intelligently in the classic the invisible man from 1933  there is one scene of violence in particular that is so incredibly ambiguous  and is not mentioned once later on  if more attention had been paid it  kevin bacon s mad scientist might have made a little more sense   br    br   the movie would actually be much more successful as a porno  since the premise could actually be carried out in a unique and interesting manner  but this piece of work    go see something else  or don t  and live with the consequences  br    br   3 10',\n  'i rarely make these comments but i felt compelled to spare others the pain i endured in watching this movie  it s so stupid and implausible both in the overall story and in the details that you simply can t suspend disbelief  the problem starts early  when you see a government researcher tooling around in a new porsche and dining with his team in a restaraunt that looks like a castle  overlooking the capitol building in washington  d c  that kind of life on a government salary  hah  it only gets worse  toward the end  when the bad guy starts killing off the good guys  the latter group act so stupidly that you want them to die  in order to cleanse the gene pool  the special effects are pretty good   any producer s money can buy that   and the lead actors have been great in other films  but the screenplay and direction here are moronic  many people have wondered whether there was some deliberate intelligence behind paul verhoeven s previous  facially stupid movies  showgirls  starship troopers   but this movie should stop the wondering  he s just plain bad ',\n  'this picture started out with good intentions  bacon the scientist out to test the theory of invisibility  and shue is cute as usual in her role  it all falls apart after that  it s your typical hollywood thriller now  filmed on a soundstage with special effects galore  minus any kind of humour  wit or soul  in other words  don t waste your time watching this  get the audiocassette tape with john delancie as the invisible man instead  also starring leonard nimoy  now that was good  and hg wells is well served  unlike with this mess ',\n  'c mon guys some previous reviewers have nearly written a novel commenting on this episode  it s just an old 60 s tv show   this episode of star trek is notable because of the most serious babe  yeoman barrow s  ever used on star trek and the fact that it was filmed in a real outdoor location  unlike the tng and voyager series which were totally confined to sound stages  br    br   this use of an outdoor location  and babe  gives proper depth and an almost film like quality to a quite ordinary episode of this now dated and very familiar show  br    br   except a few notable exceptions i e  the city on the edge of forever     assignment earth  and  tomorrow is yesterday  the old series of star trek needs to be seriously moth balled and put out of it s boring misery  half a dozen good episodes from 79 is quite a poor batting average  br    br   this is typical of the boring stuff gene roddenberry produced back then actually  contrary to popular belief where some people worshiped the ground he walked on  he actually made a lot of rubbish  he doesn t deserve to be spoken of in the same breath as irwin allen for example  br    br   just look at the set of the bridge of the enterprise from a modern point of view  they used wobbly plywood for the floor  cafeteria chairs with plastic backs and cheap cardboard above the instrument panels  you can clearly see the folds in the paper   every expense spared or what  ',\n  'okay  now what the hell is this supposed to be  is it a family fantasy movie to cash in further on the huge success of spielberg s  close encounters of the third kind   or a throwback to the glorious days of prehistoric epics such as  when dinosaurs ruled the earth  and  the lost world   perhaps it s an intellectual   philosophical masterpiece we all fail to comprehend  yes  that must be it  whatever it is  the creators of  the day time ended   good old john  bud  cardos of  kingdom of the spiders  and writer david schmoeller of  tourist trap   must have been sniffing quite a lot glue when they penned down the ideas for this demented hodgepodge of genres  the story doesn t make the slightest bit of sense and the narrative structure is incoherent as hell but  hey  who cares as long as it s got papier mâché dinosaurs  miniature spacecrafts  headache inducing light   laser shows and spontaneously combusting supernovas  the voice over introduction is practically inaudible  but no worries as it s all gibberish  did you know that the definition of  time  isn t what we all think it is  time doesn t necessarily pass by chronologically  it is one giant paradox  words that were spoken thousands of years ago are still floating around now and even things that will happen in the future are already surrounding us  i have absolutely no idea what all this means  but apparently it provides an easy excuse to gather tap dancing midget aliens and well mannered dinosaurs on screen together  i deliberately say well mannered dinosaurs  because at a certain point one of the prehistoric monsters politely knocks on the front door before menacing his targets  the crazy plot revolves on a family of weirdos living in their solar powered house in the middle of nowhere  grandpa is extremely annoying  the granddaughter even more  granny is a walking   talking advertisement billboard for plastic surgery  the youngest son strangely resembles prince valiant and the young mother is \\x85 incredibly hot  chris mitchum for some reason also pointless wanders around the filming sets as the hot mommy s husband on business travel  the special effects are purely cheesy and absolutely laughable  i sincerely hope that the

incredibly childish and not worth bothering for fantasy movie  though i can totally understand that some of its fans cherish the film because they saw it at young age and became fascinated with the flamboyant effects  the ending completely comes out of nowhere  like they suddenly ran out of money or like the effects of the mushrooms they were eating wore out unexpectedly ',\n  'i saw this when it was in the theater  it started out so strong i mean back in 1980 this was a bold movie and the special effects were excellent at the time  now you would have to of been at least 30 or so in 1980 to really understand this point because studying film historically misses the mind set at the time the expectations  and other related psychological factors  now as i said the movie was engaging suspenseful and very entertaining  it builds to an excellent climax then     it ends i mean the person that described it as having a water balloon break in your hand before throwing it  besides being a very poetic description  in my experience  it was just not strong enough  my wife and i were well    how can i say this  we were upset  i mean we paid money  invested the time to watch the movie which was excellent   we both felt we were robbed with an ending that convinced us both the production company must of run out of money and could not raise enough to finish it correctly  in fact my wife said it best  it did not end  it just stopped ',\n  'when i ordered this from blockbuster s website i had no idea that it would be as terrible as it was  who knows  maybe i d forgotten to take my

gem of the disco era was glory bound for the dumpster  br    br   the first foretelling of just how bad things were to be was the narration at the beginning  trying to explain what cosmic forces were at play to wreak havoc upon the universe  forcing polyester and porno quality music on the would be viewer  from the opening scene with the poorly done effects to the  monsters  from another world and then the house which jumps from universe to universe was as achingly painful as watching an elementary school production of  the vagina monologues   br    br   throughout the film  the sure sign something was about to happen was when a small ship would appear  the  ship  was comprised suspiciously of what looked like old vcr and camcorder parts and would attack anyone in its path  of course if moved slower than bob barker s impacted bowels  but it had menacing pencil thin armatures and the ability to cast a ominous green glow that could stop bullets and equipped with a laser capable of cutting through mere balsa wood in an hour or two  with some assistance   br    br   moving on    as the weirdness and bell bottoms continue    we found out that they re caught in a  space time warp

cinema  so after watching the trailer for  water lilies   i expected to like this film because i thought i d stumbled on something unique  a movie that honestly portrays teen lesbian love   sort of a female version of  beautiful thing    br    br   the main characters are young french women 15 years old  marie is slender  reticent and pretty in a tomboyish way  floriane is outgoing  athletic and beautiful  and anne is loyal  pudgy and behaviorally immature  the erotic interrelationship between marie and floriane is always simmering in this movie  if not at the surface  then just below it   br    br    water lilies   however  is not about the dawning of lesbian love upon two teens  it is about sexual frustration  suffering  ennui  teens working at cross purposes and   in at least two instances   joyless  mechanical sex  it also proves that screenwriters and film makers mar their own creations when they become too manipulative  br    br   in the extra features on the  lord of the flies  dvd  director peter brook says   french cynicism starts with the arousal of sex   meaning the french regard children as angels while they regard adolescents and adults with a pervasive cynicism  part of the downfall of this film is film maker celine sciamma has gulped a mighty dose of this cynicism  br    br    where is the joy   i asked myself while watching this film  yes  first love can be painful and frustrating  but it can also be joyful and triumphantly erotic in a fresh  life affirming way  these positive aspects are missing from this movie  there is no balance  br    br   organically  this movie wants to be a poignant celebration of first love  but sciamma is too impressed with her own cynicism and cleverness and ruins the film  first  what is the point of showing only the plump girl nude  i know there is an established tradition of tasteful teen nudity in european cinema  as evidenced by films like  the slingshot  the rascals  the devil  probably  the little thief  murmur of the heart  friends  beau pere  and  europa  europa   but this instance is a petty authorial intrusion    see  audience  i can make a film where i show only the unattractive person nude   either no nudity or evenly distributed nudity would ve been an honest way to go  br    br   there is a scene in a club where floriane and marie are dancing  what follows next is not just floriane cynically manipulating marie  it is film maker sciamma cynically manipulating her audience  br    br   perhaps the biggest betrayal of authenticity and organic honesty takes place when floriane warns marie she s about to request something that is  not normal   marie understandably asks   who cares about being normal   then sciamma plays false with her audience and the hurtling momentum of the movie  because floriane s request is a phony  derivative and substitute question   not the authentic  heartfelt question the movie  marie s character and the viewers who ve invested their time deserve   br    br   here are also two moments which clank falsely on the viewer s nerves  1  since when do the french   of all people   take baths wearing bathing suits  and with a turtle to boot  2  what teen   of any nationality   would chomp down on an apple core that s been thrown in the garbage in order to get a taste of the beloved s mouth  br    br   the three main actresses are promising and

of the theory and support his investigation  simultaneously with his visit a series of serial murders takes place  each victim killed in a similar manner and each murder apparently accompanied by

jeffrey  jim thalman  with whom he has a cat and mouse attraction and a prominent doctor burroughs  richard conti  who seems oddly involved in the cast of suspects  how this all come to an end is the play of the film  a story as much about the search for self identity between stefan and jeffery as it is a case for investigation of murders  br    br   while tom wlaschiha  jim thalman and richard conti do well with their roles  they are the only three who have any prior acting experience in the film    the quality of the film sags considerably by the less than acceptable minimally talented

all the film is drowned by the incessant replay of  nessun dorma  as sung by mario del monaco from a recording o the opera   and that seems to be the reason for making the film  good idea for a film

much credence to aids conspiracy theories but its sociologically interesting to see the phenomenon dramatized  in the early years of the aids epidemic  the suffering and paranoia of the scared and

uglier than in this film  a sense of darkness and decomposition pervades every scene  br    br   while the acting and plot can t be said to be well done the films unique cultural context and

and lacking  the acting is borderline comical  while i love paul muni  i can now say i have seen a film that does not do his true ability justice  the only saving grace i found with this film is it s production value  the use of hundreds of extras throughout the film creates a very believable and interesting environment  also  the beautiful effects used to create the illusion of millions of wasps sells easily and was revolutionary at the time  other than the production value i can say little else that is good or entertaining about this film ',\n  'the good earth is not a great film by any means  it is way to ordinary  maybe it was different in the 1930 s but who would want to see the life of a farmer  it is not very interesting to me  yes  luis rainer and paul muni do an excellent job acting but the film dragged on way too long  i could have told you the ending of this movie by the first act  in short wang lung  muni  a small time farmer who does not want to be like his own father turns out exactly like him  both falling in love with their wives just as they are on their death beds  the film does a complete 360 going from one generation to the next  also this film did not have any good character actors or funny moments  it just was depressing stuff about lasting as a farmer during a time of crisis ',\n  'a couple of farmers struggle in life in a small village in china  wang

ideology  a good wife  many children and land are the best things for men to have  they are seen as property and investment  because it is a big budget movie  in which many extras cooperate  big sets are built and special effects take place  the movie makers could not take the risk of hiring less popular actors  luise rainer won an academy award for this performance  which is definitely the worst in the movie  her immutable face builds a barrier between her and the audience  o lan is supposed to be the heart of the family and the best character to sympathize with  on the other hand paul muni gives a better performance  showing his talent ones again  another problem with the movie is the ending  it seems like franklin did not know when to end the picture  this film could be dangerous if it is taken as a truly example of chinese culture and traditions ',\n  'luise rainer received an oscar for her performance in the good earth  unfortunately  her role required no  she did not say much and looked pale throughout the film  luise s character was a slave then given away to marriage to paul muni s character  he did a fantastic job for his performance   set in ancient asia  both actors were not asian  but were very convincing in their roles  i hope that paul muni received an oscar for his performance  because that is what luise must have gotten her oscar for  she must have been a breakthrough actress  one of the first to method act  this seems like something that hollywood does often  al pacino has played an italian and cuban  i felt luise s performance to be lackluster throughout  and when she died  she did not change in expression from any previous scenes  she stayed the same throughout the film  she only changed her expression or emotion maybe twice  if her brilliant acting was so subtle  i suppose i did not see it ',\n  'well i m probably about to be lambasted by everyone on this site  but the good earth is one of the worst structured films i ve seen in a long time  we have a 2 and a half hour film that feels like its three and a half because it has two films in one  the first film tells the story of a family that has to move form their home because of drought and famine  they have to travel south to the cities to find food or work of some kind  conveniently they happen to find a bag of jewels and at the same time they find out that the drought has ended  yeah ok  with this knowledge they return home with their riches and everything is fine and wonderful again   br    br   well that takes about an hour and a half of film and while its incredibly lifeless at this point it does have a nice arc to it  you would think this would be a fantastic place to end the film  however  the film then continues on for a whole other hour  and in this remaining time  its takes a simple story about a family dealing with the hardships of the world and turns it into a sappy melodrama about betrayal and jealousy between lovers  oh yea and the age old  money is the root of all evil blah blah blah  just because you know your making an epic film doesn t mean that your story can go on needlessly for more than it has to  also the main idea i would gather about this film is that the earth is good to this family and holds them together  then why do we spend an hour telling a story about a rich man falling in love with another woman  and why is the final moment of the film dedicated to a wife that our main character hasn t even cared about through most of the film   br    br   oh wait and the film isn t the only thing thats poorly written  the main characters wife makes absolutely no sense  she complains a lot about how she was a slave and she never wants to have a slave and yadda yadda yadda  then why at the drop of a hat is she willing to sell her only daughter into slavery  even if they are starving at the time of this idea  it still doesn t make sense when 20 minutes later in the film she is complaining about not wanting a slave again   br    br   there are other films from the thirties that should be paid attention to  the only thing this one has going for it is the cinematography  the land is shot beautifully  oh and the sequence with the locusts is quite impressive  too bad that were in a film that had nothing to say   br    br   one last thing  i know that at this point in time hollywood was focused mostly on stars and they figured that a good actor can portray anything  for most of the film paul muni does portray an asian man to the best of his ability  but once it hits the half point where the film goes on for no reason he loses it and just becomes regular old italian paul  they even cut his hair so he looks like tony from scarface also a better film than this   of all the main characters in the film i think maybe three are actually asian  the rest are just americans being silly  oh and please ms  rainer that was a really nice one note performance  not  if i could i rip the oscar out of your hands  oh i would   br    br   the good earth is one epic waste of time  if you want something along this vain to watch on nice evening get the grapes of wrath  a film that truly deserves all the praise it gets  mainly because it wasn t written by a monkey ',\n  'the good earth follows the life a slave girl and a poor farmer in china  the movie is based on the novel by pearl s  buck  the story is great  but i hated that they decided to cast anglos in the lead roles  walter connolly is laughable as the farmer s father  he has such a heavy american accent  as do most of the lead actors  that i could not bear listening to him speak  br    br   it is a shame that hollywood could not get past their racist beliefs to cast asians in the lead roles  to take anglos and make them look like chinese is akin to anglos putting shoe polish on their faces to play african americans ',\n  'well  what was fun    except for the fun part  br    br   it s my second least favorite so far  i even thought it was

limitations set before you  scarecrow s script seems to have been written in a drunken haze  i could go through about fifteen examples of the nonsensical scripting of this movie  but i ll just mention one  the gravedigger  the character of the gravedigger is introduced about an hour into the movie  he seemingly has no connection to any of the other characters already in the movie  he is shown with his daughter  who also has no connection to anybody else in the movie  the gravedigger is given a couple scenes to act surly in and then is killed to pad out the body count  why give the gravedigger a daughter  why give the daughter a boyfriend  why introduce them so late in the movie  why not try to make them part of the ongoing storyline  scarecrow doesn t seem to care  br    br   the  story  of scarecrow goes something like this  lester is a high school kid  played by and actor who d i d peg to be in his early 30 s  who is picked on by the other kids  he is an artist who draws birds and has a crush on a classmate named judy  his mom is a lush and the town whore  one of her reprobate boyfriends makes fun of his drawings  by calling him a  faggot  for drawing birds instead of  monsters and cowboys   if you have a high school student still drawing cowboys i d think him to more likely be gay than a high school student who draws crows  and later  kills lester  in a cornfield  under the titular scarecrow  magically  lester s soul goes into the scarecrow  somehow  this transference changes lester s soul from that of an artist into that of a wisecracking gymnast  i know some reviews have called the scarecrow a kung fu scarecrow  i disagree  the scarecrow practically does a whole floor routine before jumping onto the truck during the climax of the movie   the scarecrow then goes on to kill those who tormented him  those who smoke pot in the corn field  those who dig graves  boyfriends of daughters of gravediggers  pretty much anyone who showed up on the movie set  br    br   the bonus feature on the dvd should be mentioned  the director  a frenchman  does an impromptu version of rap music  admits he enjoys not having executives around on set so he can screw his wife while

technique of having a scene cut up into different shots rather than being just one continuous shot  ex  guy is trying to light his weed and the camera circles around him  instead of just one shot  he

there was a lot of character development which made the film better to watch  then after the kid came back to life as the scarecrow  there was a mindless hour and ten minutes of him killing people  the violence was overly excessive and i think the bodycount was higher than twelve which is a large number for movies like this  almost every character in the film is stabbed or gets their head chopped off  but the teacher who called him  white trash  and  hoodlum   though the character lester is anything but a hoodlum  not even close  i know hoods and am part hood  they don t draw in class  they sit there and throw stuff at the teacher   the teacher deserved a more gruesome death than anyone of the characters  but was just stabbed in the back  there were two suspenseful scenes in the film  but didn t last long enough to be scary at all  as i said  the killings were excessive and sometimes people who have nothing to do with the story line get their heads chopped off  if the gore was actually fun to see  then it would ve been nc 17  two kids describe a body they find in the cornfields  they describe it as a lot gorier than it actually was  they explained to the cop that there were maggots crawling around in the guys intestines  his stomach had not even been cut open so there was no way maggots were in his stomach  though i would ve liked to see that  the acting was

tobe hooper  basically dedicating this movie to those great directors is like giving your mother a piece of sh t for mother s day  the first thing they did wrong was the casting  cast people that can act  also  don t cast a person that is 40 years old for the role of a misunderstood  18 year old recluse  that s right  he s been in high school for 22 years  the reactions made by people as they watch their boyfriends get their hearts ripped out is amusing  or like one part when a guy gets stabbed in the ear with an ear of corn  haha get it   and his girlfriend just goes   oh  my   god   the scarecrow himself is quite a character  doing flips off cars and calling people losers  br    br   the movie does have one redeeming factor    oh wait  no it doesn t  br    br   if you absolutely must see this movie  than just watch the rock and roll trailer on the dvd  it covers about everything and has a really gnarly song dude ',\n  'scarecrow is set in the small american town of emerald grove where high school student lester dwervick  tim young  is considered the local nerdy geek by teachers   fellow students alike  the poor kid suffers daily humiliation  bullying  teasing   general esteem destroying abuse at the hands of his peers  unfortunately he doesn t find much support at home since his mom is a slut   after lester annoys one of her blokes he chases him into a corn field   strangles the poor kid  however something magical happens  no  the film doesn t suddenly become good   lester s spirit gets transfered into the corn fields scarecrow which he then uses as a body to gain revenge on those who tormented him   made his life hell    br    br   co written  co produced   directed by emmanuel itier who according to the imdb credit list also has a role in the film as someone called mr  duforq although i don t remember any character of this name  i suppose anyone who ends up looking at the imdb pages for scarecrow will probably already be aware of it s terrible reputation   i have to say it pretty much well deserved since it s terrible  the script by itier  bill cunningham   jason white uses the often told story of one of life s losers who gets picked upon   tormented for no good reason getting their revenge by supernatural means in a relatively straight forward teen slasher flick  we ve seen it all before  we ve seen killer scarecrows before  we ve seen faceless teens being killed off one by one before  we ve seen one of life s losers get his revenge before  we ve seen wise cracking villains who make jokes as they kill before   we ve seen incompetent small town sheriff s make matters even worse before  the only real question to answer about scarecrow is whether it s any fun to watch on a dumb teen slasher type level  the answer is a resounding no to be honest  the film has terrible character s  awful dialogue  an inconsistent   predictable story  it has some cheesy one liners like when the scarecrow kills someone with a shovel he ask s  can you dig it     the so called twist ending which is geared towards leaving things open for a sequel is just lame  the film moves along at a reasonable pace but it isn t that exciting   the kills are forgettable  you know i m still trying to work out how someone can be stabbed   killed with a stick of corn    br    br   director itier doesn t do a particularly good job here  the kill scenes are poorly handled with no build up whatsoever which means there s never any tension as within two seconds of a character being introduced they are killed off  also i m not happy with the killer scarecrow dude doing all these back flips   somersaults through the air in scenes which feel like they belong in the matrix  1999  or some japanese kung fu flick  to give it some credit the actual scarecrow mask looks really good   he looks pretty cool but he is given little to do except spout bad one liners   twirl around a bit  don t you think that being tied to a wooden stake in the middle of a corn filed all day would have been boring  i know he s a killer scarecrow but i still say he would have been bored just hanging around on a wooden stick all day  there s no nudity   the gore isn t anything to write home about  there s a decapitation  someones face is burnt  someone is killed with a stick of corn  someone gets a shovel stuck in their throat  some sickles are stuck in people s heads  someone has their heart ripped out   someone has a metal thing stuck through the back of their head which comes out of their mouth  br    br   with a supposed budget of about  250 000 this was apparently shot in 8 days  well at least they didn t waste any time on unimportant things like story   character development  technically this is pretty much point  shoot   hope for the best stuff  if you look at the guy on the floor who has just had his heart ripped out you can clearly see him still breathing    the acting sucks  the guy who played lester s mum s bloke is wearing the most stupid looking wig   fake moustache ever because he played two roles in the film   the makers needed to disguise him but they just ended up making him look ridiculous   don t get me started on his accent    br    br   scarecrow has a few fun moments   the actual scarecrow himself is a nice creation with good special make up effects but as a whole the film is poorly made  badly acted  silly  too predictable   very cheesy  if you want to see a great killer scarecrow flick then check out scarecrows  1988   not to be confused with the gene hackman   al pacino film scarecrow  1973  or the upcoming horror flick scarecrow  2008  which is currently in production  scarecrow proved popular enough on home video to spawn two more straight to video sequels  scarecrow slayer  2003    scarecrow gone wild  2004  ',\n  'this movie is so aggrivating  the main character looks like he s 35 and i ve seen scrawny beanpoles with more balls than this guy  the plot twists are so predictable its not even worth watching for the humor factor  br    br   also some of the worst dialogue i ve heard in 3 years   lets go find a small animal to torture   br    br   ugh     i can t even continue  don t watch this pile of garbage  it was made in 8 days  br    br   the one highlight is the drunk dude calling the main character a faggot for drawing pictures  br    br   2 out of 10  unwatchable',\n  'holy      this movie was still warm and juicy from the pile it was made with  i tried to watch this pile of festering waste but found it easier to slash my wrists and slug back a shooter of lysol floor cleaner than endure more than half of the crap that was on my screen  i rank this well below anything i have ever watched on film or tv  and thats saying something  i once witnessed a cow crap in a field  i watched the steaming pile for a hour and a half  who knows    it might have moved or something  well that was time better spent than watching this tripe  the acting was non existent  the plot was somewhere other than on this film  i think i saw a cut seen early on where the plot managed to escape and was riding off in the background on the back of a old pickup truck heading to portland in hopes of becoming a steven king shi77er  please tell me director is getting medication he so desperately needs  it s pretty clear he needs heavy medication and i d willing to front the money needed for his lobotomy reversal  bah    i can t give this review the full punch it needs because nothing this painful can ever be done justice in typed word alone  let me just say that if your looking for a flick to pass some time and you see this chilton on the rack  walk to your car  start the engine  then shove both of your fists straight into the fan until it you can t feel your bones vibrate anymore  be sure to have your wallet in hand also because you were going to waste the cash anyway  you might as well have the privilege of wasting it yourself  br    br   by the way  i watched this after a  buddy  of mine sent his girlfriend over so i could see it  he dint come over  she had too  whats worse is that she had to watch this      thing twice  i heard their married now and he gets to visit his balls once a month  i hope it was because of this film ',\n  'i saw this not too long ago  and i must say  this movie is terrible  i watch crappy movies for fun  scarecreow is not fun  scarecrow is stupid  you have an incredibly corny villain that enjoys screaming awful puns as he kills his victims actually worse than the one contained in this sentence   he has his hard luck story that he uses to justify his killings   everyone picks on me  the only girl that thinks i m not trailer trash likes one of the guys that pick on me  i want to kill everybody  wah   ok  i m exaggerating  but the premise to this movie alone is enough to put it near the bottom of the list of crappy movies  br    br   adding to what i just said  the kid s mom is promiscuous  he walks in on his mother and her current boyfriend getting it on  mom s boyfriend tells him to leave  kid refuses  insisting that he isn t going to leave his own house  boyfriend chases kid into corn field  he kills kid right in front of mom  mom screams in terror  boyfriend is like   omg  i didn t mean to   then he tells mom not to say anything to the police about it  kid was killed under a scarecrow  though  so  like any kid who gets murdered under a scarecrow  he comes back as a killer scarecrow with a vengeance  his victims  haven t been stalked like this before      scarecrow s official tag line  br    br   to make matters worse  this movie was filmed in a whopping 8 days  that s right  8 days  i was going to give this movie a 2  because in spite of itself  it has one or two redeeming moments   they re spoilers  so i won t spoil it for you  if you actually want to see this crap   i could have somewhat forgiven the bad acting  the horrible special effects  the abysmal script  and the bad camera work  but i simply have no respect for lack of effort on that level  br    br   this movie isn t nearly as good as i m making it out to be  if you want to see an example of how not to make a movie  or if you enjoy watching bad movies  like i do  then watch this at your own risk  everyone else should stay a safe distance away from this movie at all times ',\n  'wow is all i can say if your reading this is either watched it or are thinking about it  trust me watch it  br    br   i laughed so hard at so many parts of this movie the worst acting ever made is very funny  i cant believe they superimposed the school sign  i must have played that scene over and over again just to laugh more and more every time  if a movie like this can be made it gives us all hope in making our own movies  even the costume was bad  it looked like my 7 year old cousin could have done a better job on making it  heck i bet he could have written and acted better as well  all i know is that i have to watch the second part just so i can see if it was as bad as the first  its a cool idea about a killer scarecrow but a much better job could have been done  hopefully another killer scarecrow movie comes out  just not like this one ',\n  'perhaps one of the worst teenage slasher films i ever did see  i ll start with the bad points of t he movie  which pretty much covers the entire film  first of all  something no one can avoid  terrible acting  i swear they picked up some random kids off the street based on how they looked  secondly  bad unconvincing character work development  you hardly even know half the kids who are killed in here  all you figure is that they deserved it one way or another  the scarecrow s character was overdone  and a cheap rip off of the other great fantasy killers such as freddy or pinhead  next  bad dialog  the scarecrow was full of horrid one liners that would make you laugh  only because it was so terrible  lines like  let s go find some small animals to torture   really just leaves you with an eyebrow raised  last but not least  next off  bad casting  how old was the guy who played lester  like 30  the back of his head was balding for god s sake  there is much more i could say about this film  like it s cheap special effects  it s  high school film class  effort  but the point is understood  it s just bad film making at it s worst  as for what i found to be  good  in the movie   entertaining for those with low  low  low standards  would help put insomniacs to sleep   a very cheap laugh  or even a giggle ',\n  'first off  let me start with a quote a friend of mine said while watching this movie   this entire movie had to have been a dare  you know  like   dude  i bet you couldn t make the worst movie ever    with this movie  they ve made a good effort at achieving that title  the effects are  of course  poor  the plot dialogue is like a collage of of bits stolen from every b horror movie ever made  the actors  i m assuming  are supposed to be in college  yet parts of it  especially at the beginning  make it seem like they re supposed to be in high or middle school  it makes no sense  the scarecrow going around killing people isn t the least bit enjoyable   spoiler  at the end  when they chant lester s name and he reappears  the black guy and scarecrow are both laughing  probably out of relief they were on their last scene  and at the cheesy dialogue  ',\n  'let s face it  some lame kid who dies and has his soul transfered into a scarecrow  das no gonna happen neva  omfg this stupid loser kid who can t stand up for himself gets his ass handed to him by some drunk bastard screwing his mom  right as he dies  he looks up at the scarecrow and he let s his spirit go into the scarecrow  the drunk guy covered up his death by making it seem suicidal and thought he had gotten away with it  we later see he is tossed out of the trailer and later earns another encounter with the scarecrow  they had a brief encounter which includes the drunk calling him a loser and the scarecrow rebounding with  takes one to know one  loser   the scarecrow flips off the building  calls him  daddy o   and then beheads the poor man  we can see how this awesome movie unfolds from that  he goes on to kill many people  afterward  he mainly kills the people who gave him a hard time in rl and goes off to kill some random ass people  just for some laughs  no laughing here  he adds a punchline to every kill  too  every time he killed someone  he would do some karate flips and finish it all off with one of his signature punchlines  in the case of someone who was hard of hearing  he would say  here  have an ear of corn   then shove it up their ass  or we can actually take an example from the movie  he just got done killing a cop and was on his way to killing the only person who ever stood up for him  her father  the sheriff  yelled to the madman to stop  and he said  hey  stay awhile   and threw a dagger threw his chest and stuck him onto some tree  in the end of the movie  he killed two guys and threw in the punchline  gotta split   and killed two guys by shoving a scythe into their heads  wowzors  this movie made me want to cream my pants so bad  maybe next time this guy makes a movie  it won t be gay ',\n  'i ve gotta say  i usually like horror movies that i ve never seen    however  this one was just to pathetic for my gory taste  i m used to the gory  gut wrenching types    but this particular movie was lame  the acting was horrible  yet the corny  no pun intended  one liners were cute   and the sequel to it  scarecrow slayer was even worse  yes  probably  when it first came out  there was a huge rave about it and people liked it  but when movies like the ring and the exorcist of emily rose come out  movies like these make movies like scarecrow seem childish  if you want a movie to just pass the time  pick this one  the special effects are cheesy as heck  but seeing that it was a low budget movie  i can kind of see where that would come in  this will kind of remind you of the movie  children of the corn   independent movies rock     most of the time  so if you want to see a scarecrow killing people with corncobs  or in the sequel  2 scarecrows going at it  then these movies would be for you ',\n  'i m watching this on the sci fi channel right now  it s so horrible i can t stop watching it  i m a videographer and this movie makes me sad  i feel bad for anyone associated with this movie  some of the camera work is good  most is very questionable  there are a few decent actors in the flick  too bad they re surrounded by what must have been the director s relatives  that s the only way they could have been qualified to be in a movie  music was a little better than the acting  if you get around to watching this i hope it s because there was absolutely no other option  the sequel  yes sequel  is coming on now    i think i ll skip it  jason',\n  'wow  what can i say about this film  it s a lousy piece of crap  i m surprised that it got rated as high as it did  what s wrong with this film  here s a better question  what s not wrong with this film  br    br   the story itself is just crap and cliché  here s pretty much what it s about   some kinda nerdy kid with no friends gets picked on  gets killed  and comes back as a scarecrow for revenge   all  of that is packed into 86 minutes of worthless film  if you haven t seen this movie don t waste your time watching it  also  the second one isn t much better  so don t bother watching that either   i rated this movie a three because i liked the scarecrow s outfit  not because there was anything good about the movie  i think you get the picture ',\n  'a far as b movies go  scarecrow is one of those that are so bad  that it becomes incredibly annoying to sit through  a lonely loser high school student who is constantly picked on by classmates and rejected by girls  ends up walking in on his trailer trash mother having sex with a drunk redneck  he then chases the kid out into a nearby cornfield and kills him  apparently  the kids soul was transfered into a scarecrow which then goes around killing the bullies who tormented him as well as teachers  this scarecrow  aside from having a snappy one liner for each of his victims  can also do matrix like flips through the air and kill people on sidewalks in broad daylight  also  why did he always look like a rotted corpse  just like the two needless sequels that followed this  this isn t even worth a laugh ',\n  'okay   enjoy  is a pretty relative term  but flexibility is in order when you re dealing with a filmmaker of james glickenhaus  calibre  br    br   mcbain is truly one of the most ridiculous  over the top action films i ve ever seen  without the nasty edge of the exterminator  other reviews have commented on a suspension of disbelief regarding the film s heroic middle aged commandos  but how about making a film in the philippines that is set in colombia  all the extras are filipino  in fact the only character who looks remotely hispanic is good ol  victor argo as the much reviled  el presidente   oh yes  we also have maria conchita alonso overemoting like crazy as a rebel leader  there are tons of explosions and bodies flying everywhere in this amusing paean to the glories of american imperialism ',\n  'i purchased this film on the cheap in a sale  having read the back of the dvd case and assuming that either way i can t lose  it if was rubbish then no loss  if it was any good then bargain    br    br   then i watched it    br    br   i am normally a fan of christopher walken  but in this film he commanded very little screen presence  seeming not to do a whole lot  even the death of his friend near the beginning which sparks off the  action  in the plot seems to affect him very little  and his eventual revenge is just boring and undramatic  br    br   normally a film which has themes as grand as revolution and revenge are able to capture the audience and snare them into feeling something for the characters  however watching this film felt more like seeing a series of confused  and almost random events that loosely tied together towards it s eventual conclusion    br    br   at this point i wept    br    br   i thought this film was the most horribly painful piece of viewing i have ever been subjected to  the scene where the pilot sacrifices himself by refusing to jump out the explosive laden truck due to not wanting to kill any civilians is not so much tragically sad as it is unnervingly horrible and painful  although not quite as bad as the emergency surgery on the wounded girl  the acting was poor all round  the script and story was weak  the  action  was even weaker  and the  visuals  were but bluntly not all that visual  to summarise there are films which are good  films that are bad  films that are so bad they are good  films that are terrible    br    br   and then on a whole new level is  mcbain ',\n  'this was an absolutely terrible movie  don t be lured in by christopher walken or michael ironside  both are great actors  but this must simply be their worst role in history  even their great acting could not redeem this movie s ridiculous storyline  this movie is an early nineties us propaganda piece  the most pathetic scenes were those when the columbian rebels were making their cases for revolutions  maria conchita alonso appeared phony  and her pseudo love affair with walken was nothing but a pathetic emotional plug in a movie that was devoid of any real meaning  i am disappointed that there are movies like this  ruining actor s like christopher walken s good name  i could barely sit through it ',\n  'creep is the story of kate  potente   an intensely unlikeable bourgeois bitch that finds herself somehow sleeping through the noise of the last underground train  and waking up to find herself locked in the tube station  after somehow meeting workmate and would be rapist guy on a mystery train that runs after the lines have closed  things go awry and she finds herself pursued by what lurks beneath the city s streets  her story is linked to that of george  blackwood   an ex con working in the sewer system  they meet in the final third of the film  brought together by their attempts to escape the monster that pursues them  br    br   the pair proceed through a set of increasingly unlikely locations  from the tube station  they end up in the sewage works before somehow finding themselves in some sort of abandoned underground surgery  most tube stations don t have toilets  so how one has a surgery is beyond me  naturally  the film cares to explain that the surgery doesn t have running water  yet it has electricity  just one of many inconsistencies that work against the atmosphere of everyday believability that the film tries to create  br    br   the monster itself is a problem  there s a complete lack of reasoning for its actions  it just kills people for no obvious reason  and then of course it keeps some alive for no real reason either  perhaps just so that they can eventually escape and give the film an extra 15 minutes or so running time  i understand that natural evil is supposed to be scary  but then the film attempts to explain itself via a photo of a doctor and his son  and a few shots of some jars containing babies  and yes  it is just as tired and pathetic as it sounds  it also fails to explain how the creature has been underground long enough to lose the ability to speak  communicating only in raptor screams  but not long enough for its pair of shorts to decay  hmm  br    br   this doctor business leads to scene that is the film s desperate attempt to implant itself on your memory  and while it is gory and uncomfortable to watch  it just isn t enough  the final third of the film hinges on an emotional relationship that never existed  and the characters break down and recover for little or no obvious reason  george breaks down  unable to cope with something despite stating that he wants to escape so he can see his daughter again  and kate becomes emotionally tough seconds after going to pieces over someone that ripped her off for a travelcard  yeah  br    br   after starting out as a  this could happen to anyone  movie  it quickly falls apart as it introduces ideas that make it more and more unrealistic  a complete lack of emotional interest in the characters and an absence of suspense make this one to avoid ',\n  'the london underground has something inherently creepy about it  with its long winding tunnels  the escalators taking you deeper and deeper underground  and of course the rats roaming the tracks it a source of wonder that it is not used in horror films more often  it was used in the seventies horror deathline aka raw meat  featuring a cannibalistic tribe living in a disused tunnel  and the celebrated chase sequence in american werewolf in london  so i was pleased to see that someone else had tried to capitalise on the atmosphere of the tube at night with the recent uk production creep  br    br   i thought the film started off well  with a highly effective credit sequence that was genuinely unnerving  followed by a scene in the sewers that sets up the premise of there being something evil lurking below the streets of london  however  creep went downhill from here  and i found myself wishing that i d switched it off after this opening scene  leaving me with a favourable impression of the film  all the characters become unsympathetic and unlikable  even potente herself  and the director felt the need to hit us over the head with social commentary about homelessness  he also made the mistake of showing the  monster  in full lighting  where he ceases to become remotely scary  and reveals his name to be craig  how can you have a monster called craig  it turns into an x files type thing  and reminds one of the episode tombs  in fact  i was wishing mulder and scully would turn up and sort them all out for me  br    br   as for the infamous sexualised violence  it is very graphic  disturbing and totally unnecessary  it seems to be there merely to shock the audience rather than for any intrinsic plot value  the trouble is it is so over the top and horrific that it actually numbs you to the rest of the horror  which is a mistake as it s only halfway through the film  br    br   so there you go  the only redeeming feature of the film for me was a rare appearance from ken campbell  one of my favourite occasional actors  you don t see him very often  but when he s on screen he acts everyone else into a corner  casting him as a sewer inspector was a stroke of genius  unfortunately the only one evident in the film ',\n  'the potential was there  i saw creep and thought   oooh  this is getting interesting  several times  yet somehow the interesting plot lines wound up unexplained or ignored  like they never happened  the lead character was irritating throughout the movie  and at one point my fella and i both shouted that we wanted her to die  there are some genuinely spooky scary moments  but these are grossly overshadowed by the moments that just annoyed the hell out of me  it s another one of those horror movies that crops up and intrigues you for a while  but ultimately leaves you frustrated and a little confused about what the movie makers were trying to achieve  br    br   the one saving grace of this movie is the bad guy  but when the baddie is more likable than the lead character you know you re on to a loser ',\n  'i ll keep this short as a movie like this doesn t deserve a full review  br    br   given the setting  this movie could have been something really special  it could have been another  28 days later  or even a  blair witch project  br    br   the first 20 or so minutes of the movie i was really excited  directer did a decent job with cinematography and suspense  although i don t think he managed to capture true eeriness of an empty london underground  br    br   characters were a big let down  our  heroine  in this movie is a worthless piece of crap  and you really don t care if she dies or not  as many people have said before  i was rooting for the homeless people and the black guy  who managed to give me a chuckle or two whether intentional of the writers or not   br    br   the main villain  is kept in the dark for the first half of the movie  but when he is revealed i was really disappointed  i won t spoil it but lets just say my 10 year old sister could probably beat him in a wrestling match  br    br   all in all this is just another mediocre horror film which falls into the trap of following a simple hollywood formula  this film had a lot of potential but really failed to hit the mark  br    br   just to highlight how lame this movie was  the characters in this movie had at least five times to finish off and kill the main villain  instead they run away ',\n  'i was so disgusted by this film  i felt obligated to warn off others  this film has no story  plot or hint of purpose  the film starts after the standard  lets be scary  movie intro  which by now every film watcher has become accustomed  so we can ignore the beginning completely  we are soon introduced to the main actress and from this point it becomes clear to all that you have just wasted your hard earned and would be better off watching static   unless you have seen white noise   eek  acting is a disgrace and all of them should return to the travelling pantomime from where they came  having said that  even the best actors in the world would struggle to make this film remotely watch able  their poor performances merely contribute to the disaster  senseless violence and what i can only assume is the written word of yet another junked up  eccentric  writer  who probably considers himself to be an artist  has resulted in a film which will test your patience  it was not until my fellow watcher turned to me and said   we have been watching this for 45 mins  did i realise that this film is as thin and tasteless as a cup of tea without a tea bag  clearly something was missing and unfortunately it wasn t the audience  rather than suggest what the film is missing  let me tell you what it has  dumb blonde  surprise surprise   victims  bad monster guy thing  about 2 mins of storyline which is stretched over hours  days  weeks  months    and credits  br    br   want a silver lining  well  the blonde girl is a bit saucy looking in some of the scenes  but expect to want to see her face ripped off for the rest of the film ',\n  'absolutely laughable film  i live in london and the plot is so ill researched it s ridiculous  no one could be terrorised on the london underground  in the short time it is not in service each night there are teams of maintenance workers down there checking the tracks and performing repairs  etc  that there are homeless people living down there is equally unlikely  or that it s even possible to get locked in and not have access to a mobile phone in this day and age    br    br   the worst that s likely to happen if someone did find themselves there after the last train is that they might get graffiti sprayed on them  although this has been coming under control due to the massive number of security cameras on the network  another thorn in the side of the story   remember in london as a whole we have more security cameras than any other city in the world   br    br   if it had been set in a city i am not familiar with perhaps i could have enjoyed it through ignorance  but it s not a high quality film so i just couldn t bring myself to suspend my disbelief and try and enjoy it for the banal little tale that it is  br    br   i would have given it 0 10 if such a rating existed  possibly the most disappointing film i ever thought i would like ',\n  'yet another example of the complete waste of uk lottery money  just how commercial did this film prove  the film council  who funded this miserable garbage should be stranded  on one of the london undergrounds disused stations  for allowing this clichéd  dismal specimen to be committed to film  a half mutant thing made up of all the horror movies the director has seen and felt fit to imitate  most notably deathline  amongst its many sins is the quite obvious failure to make the lead character remotely sympathetic until the last minute  it s a little bit too late then  surely all those development executives  at the uk film council  could have noticed this at the script stage  add to this the terrible acting and the laughable appearance of the creature and you get a prime example of how not to scare ',\n  '      of course there s spoilers       i m sure this project started off as a screen writing workshop on avoiding clichés in horror movies  female protagonist   check bad things happen to drug takers   check heorine knocks out villain   check heroine doesn t notice villain recovering unconsciousness   check frame the sequence so we see recovered villain creep up behind heroine   check unfortunately it seems someone has sent this cliché list to a film studio instead of using it for class   dear oh dear if only london transport was as regular as the clichés turning up here   in fact there s so many clichés and seen it all before moments that no one actually thought about going into detail as to what the eponymous creep is or how long he s been killing people on the underground   i m led to believe it s the result of some human experiment and perhaps it s not until that night he decided to take his revenge out on humanity but all this is so vague as to be meaningless not to be totally negative i doubt very much if the producers thought they d be making a film that was going to sweep the oscars that year and there s always a market for horror movies   likewise i doubt if it cost too much produce and had one eye on the dvd market rather than cinema distribution and i will state that it s slightly better than 1972 s death line which also featured a murderous cannibal hiding in the london underground   it s just that when you think all the clichés have been used up in this film another cliché comes along to raise its ugly head',\n  '      in a horror movie that is  alright first off   lets start with kate  her main goals include getting laid by george clooney  looking good and last but not least screwing everyone over  gotta love her  she had about 3 amazingly good chances to finish off this sicko but       instead she ran  i mean she didn t wanna bring guy out for 10 minutes and when she did it was too late  i mean the guy tried to rape her  i cant get into these movies where the main character is a sad idiot  i mean who honestly would have any sympathy for a guy who finishes off everyone she has meet in a night  the movie kept going on  and as a result lost all its credibility ',\n  'okay i must say that before the revealing of the  monster   saying that he really didn t fit into that category  just some weird thing that had an annoying screech  and personally i think a granny could have ran away from that thing  but anyway  i actually was getting into this film  although having the main character a drunk and a heroine addict didn t come as an appeal  but such scenes as when she runs away from the train  and you can see the figure at the door was kind of creepy  also where the guard had just been killed and the  monster  put his hand on the screen  br    br   but then disaster stuck form the moment the monster was revealed it just became your average horror  with limited thrills or scares  slowly i became more bored  and wanted to shut the thing off  i like most people have said was rooting for the homeless people to make it  specially the guy  he gave me a few cheap laughs here and there  i think this film could have really been something special instead it became what every other horror nowadays are  just boring and well not worth the money  br    br   if you are looking for a cheap scare here and there  or a mindless gore fest  which is limited  hardly any in fact  by all means give it a go  but for all you serious horror watchers look somewhere else  much better films out there ',\n  'please  be warned  this movie  though a pretty bad storyline  was one of the most gruesome movies i have seen   ever  just remember that before you settle on your sofa to enjoy the movie  br    br   so  it officially begins with a party  just your average party but there s some guy there  he s pretty into kate   if you know what i m saying  memorise his face  it ll help later  br    br   so anyway kate goes of to find george clooney  didn t i say the plot was bad   and so takes the tube  that s london underground at the middle of the night  but she s just stupid like that  so the timetable says the next  and last  train will come in 7 minutes  now kate  dumb party girl that she is  decides that she can have a nap in the spare 7 minutes  typically  she misses the train and finds herself locked in the london underground  alone  well  almost    br    br   so the movie just carries on from there  blood  guts  limbs  even certain parts of the body i shall not mention are slashed and gashed and eventually amputated from the body  br    br   in short  it s a typical horror  pretty but thick damsel in distress type women and sick  weird psycho  or as the case may have it  creep  br    br   i d say give it a go if you re into saw  hostel or the texas chainsaw massacre but for the rest of us  scream with satisfy out horror needs thankyou very much ',\n  'this film is a perfect example of the recent crop of horror films that simply are not fully realized  there are two routes to take in horror films  either you don t really explain what s going on  or who the killer is  like in texas chainsaw massacre  or give the characters a lot of back story and characterization so that everything is explained  halloween could potentially be an example of this   br    br   unfortunately  creep fails in this area  i see absolutely no reason to give a small shred of the back story for craig without fully capturing the essence of his character or his motivation  no character is fully realized  although the circular nature of kate s character in the film is the most accomplished part of the story  br    br   in the end  this story is mostly unmotivated and none of the performances give it the necessary life to make it enthralling or interesting enough to overcome the lack of context and empty film making that drag down the film  br    br   this film will go down as another example of a film  as most are  that could be so much better even though it would never be great  the only thing that was used properly in the film was the setting  the characters  story  direction  and overall writing would have benefited from a serious face lift  br    br   creep does serve a purpose as a mindless  silly horror movie with no intellectual or emotional investment  but sadly  that s about it   ',\n  'basically what we have here is little more than a remake of the hilarious 1970 s classic kitsch horror  death line  which ironically was like this cobblers  also partly filmed at the disused aldwych underground station  br    br   making good use of the now disused jubilee line platforms at charing cross as well as the aforementioned aldwych  this film contains basically the same plot   dodgy murdering mad zombie in the tunnels preying on the lost passengers who have missed the last train   originality is not this film s strong point  br    br   indeed strong points are sadly lacking  the gore ranges from the poor to the unnecessarily over gory whilst the sub gollum nutter is never really fully explained as seems little more than an under developed plot device  br    br   franke polente has little to do with a thin script than run down a lot of tunnels and scream every so often  indeed she was like pretty much everyone else in this film  out acted by a small dog and a pack of tame rats  br    br   if creepy films set on the london underground are your bag  or you just want to play  spot the tube location  them pick this up on dvd when it hits a bargain bin  if you are looking for classic horror  go and dig up a copy of death line  aka raw meat   br    br   if you are looking for a quality well written and acted film  you will need to change trains     ',\n  'creep    your journey terminates here   some very graphic scenes and   well  yeah  that s about all for this film  br    br   no real plot  no storyline  no likable characters  well   characters  isn t correct considering you don t have a clue who anyone really is  i mean  they are being chased by some weird looking  thing  in the sewers  who is this thing  why is he there    that s quite scary i guess  but do i really care  no  i don t  why don t i  because i don t have a clue who these people are and i don t know if i should want them to live or die  it s one dimensional and relies upon gore and sound effects to scare you  which it rarely does  br    br   this film lacks any meaning  any purpose  it feels like i fell asleep and missed out the 45mins of build up  it jumps right into the action  basically  some women and her friends get locked in the london underground  get chased by a weird creature  then they eventually escape from it  br    br   creep has its moments which make you jump  the art is good  the location is excellent and the sounds are ok  but that isn t what makes a decent horror film  so unfortunately all that goes to waste  br    br   it s nothing new  another predictable modern  horror   where kate  the lead  character   consistently does the stupid  hey  i know you lot sitting at home think i should do the sensible thing in this situation  but  oooh no  i m going to do the total opposite because i m a dumb blond  thing  i wish they wouldn t do that  it s done so many times  it s boring and gets predictable  in fact  i m pretty annoyed the silly woman didn t get stabbed by the  erm  grey alien looking creature  br    br    your journey terminates here  is the films tag line  well  creeps

times in desperation that something would happen with this film  haven t we seen this all before  i didn t like any of the characters barr the guy in the sewer cage  i felt bad for him  but then again

than glitter   mariah carey in american dross par excellence  i can only imagine that the writer and producer were taking huge amounts of recreational pharmaceuticals  and when discussing the plot

a christmas tree  deathline      mind the doors  is classic of really bad british film  we really don t need a reminder  and we certainly don t need a poor  second rate  badly scripted  badly developed and badly piece of rubbish like this  all this this from the uk funding agency that brought us sex lives of the potato men    i rest my case  br    br   do not pay any money to see this  it is absolute and utter crap   the one saving grace for the producers is that they got a huge wedge of cash    our cash    for making it  they should hang their heads in shame  br    br   i am staggered at the low  low standard of this film  it makes me mgr that our national body for the support of film actually thought it was worth supporting  there is no hope for the british film industry whilst idiots are running the show  harvey wienstein where are you  come back  we forgive you   ',\n  'all logic goes straight out of the train window in this british horror film  set in the london underground and starring the usually reliable franka potente  run lola run   franka plays kate  a businesswoman on the way from an office party to meet friends who falls asleep at an underground station  only to wake up and find she has been locked in and finds herself being chased by  someone  or  something  with killer intentions  br    br   plot holes and unbelievability are rife and there are very few moments that are actually jumpy  scary but plenty that are just plain dull  br    br   all in all an unpleasant film that should just stay locked underground forever and do us all a favour  br    br   the only plus point here is the inclusion in the cast of popular veteran actor ken campbell  who s done better than this \\x96 that s even including  erasmus microman   ',\n  'i was really  really disappointed with this movie  it started really well  and built up some great atmosphere and suspense  but when it finally got round to revealing the  monster    it turned out to be just some psycho with skin problems      again  whoop de do  yet another nutjob movie   like we don t already have enough of them  br    br   to be fair  the  creep  is genuinely unsettling to look at  and the way he moves and the strange sounds he makes are pretty creepy  but i m sick of renting film like this only to discover that the monster is human  albeit a twisted  demented  freakish one  when i saw all the tell tale rats early on i was hoping for some kind of freaky rat monster hybrid thing   it was such a let down when the creep was revealed  br    br   on top of this  some of the stuff in this movie makes no sense   spoiler   br    br   why the hell does the creep kill the security guard  whats the point  apart from sticking a great honking sign up that says  hi i m a psycho and i live down here    its stupid  and only seems to happen to prevent franka potente s character from getting help  br    br   what the hells he been eating down there  i got the impression he was effectively walled in  and only the unexpected opening into that tunnel section let him loose   so has he been munching rats all that time  and if so why do they hang around him so much  why is he so damn hard to kill  he s thin  malnourished and not exactly at peak performance   but seems to keep going despite injuries that are equivalent to those that  cripple the non psycho characters in the film  br    br   the dvd commentary says we are intended to empathise with creep  but i just find him loathsome  its an effective enough movie  but it wasted so many opportunities that it makes me sick ',\n  'i was sadly disappointed by this film due to the fact that it felt false and the characters were not strong enough to carry the films pretty weak attempt at horror  the basic idea for the film was interesting but unfortunately it wasn t able to excite  really scare or shock me   there was one part in the entire film that i thought was gruesome but even that didn t redeem it  i did get to like the character of kate by the end of the film as she seemed to soften and become a little more realistic by the end  the character played by jeremy sheffield was not actually needed for this film and i think the director writer got carried away with the myriad of characters used for no purpose  if he had left it at the basic characters making it more of a solo effort on kate s part  it may have worked   jeremy s acting was wooden to say the least and i felt uncomfortable watching the bad on screen chemistry   or lack of it  such a shame  disappointing ',\n  'honestly  i went to see the movie  not because of the actors  not because of the plot but because it was rated 17 here in luxembourg and a movie has to be really brutal or pornographic to be put in this category  believe me  being a movie freak  i have seen quite a lot of brutal films in my lifetime  ichi the killer  irreversible  hellraiser  but this movie was by far the most disturbing and brutal picture i have ever seen   br    br   the plot is plain stupid  the directing is awful  acting was mediocre even the music was a cheap copy of so called  horror soundtracks   there isn t a single intelligent aspect in the whole movie  and some of the scenes are really hard to stand   especially the scene  where you see the embryos in the glasses and hear the baby cries  horrible   i can t understand why the movie was rated 16 in germany  where normally the criteria are real tough  e g  kill bill  brutal but it made fun of itself and had great allusions to asian cinema and besides a magnificent directing  even a movie like state of grace is rated 18   no one can call this a horror movie  because actually it was more about showing gore than about scaring the public  showing the  creep s  face in the middle of the movie was a very bad decision   for me  excuse my expression  it is just one insane director living out his disturbing fantasies  in some scenes you see violence  that has absolutely nothing to do with the plot nor does it explain anything  the plot has holes and flaws  the dialog is boring  honestly i can t mention a single positive aspect of the movie except for the british and scottish accent  br    br   if i had something to say  i would ban this movie from the theaters  i fully understand why none of the big production companies invested their money in this crap  br    br   i m

write a review of this imax feature as a means of warning others to save your money  almost any episode of desmond morris   the human animal  or david suzuki s  the nature of things  could have bested the material presented  not only does the director fail to make use of imax s incredible 65 to 70 mm film stock and gigantic presentation screen  everything on screen is extremely unimpressive given the accessibility of such programming mentioned previously  viewers are introduced to a pregnant heather  her husband buster  and their niece and nephew  we follow them for an interminable forty odd minutes as they eat  sweat  listen to music  etc  although we are given access to scenes inside the human digestive track and learn about babies  natural diving reflexes  do we really learn anything more than most grade school graduates  are we even remotely entertained by the trans atlantic heather  do we care  avoid this film at all cost  if you do wish to see an imax feature  i suggest the beautifully photographed  india  kingdom of the tiger  or the technically thrilling  space station 3d   trust me ',\n  'this film differentiates itself from the run of the mill  wonder of the human body  documentaries by bravely  if bizarrely  opting to elicit disgust in the viewer  in one scene  the camera closes in on a gigantic 50 foot zit as a teenager squeezes pus and fluid out of it  in another  the camera is semisubmerged in a swamp of half digested food and stomach acid as parts of a pasta salad drop in from the esophagus and plop into the goo  in a final tour de force  the camera takes the viewer on a harrowing ride through a forest of   teenage armpit hair  unfortunately  i m not making any of this up  see this film if you must  but  bring your vomit bag  and don t have pasta salad beforehand ',\n  'after what i thought was a masterful performance of two roles in man from snowy river  why was kirk douglas replaced by brian dennehy in the sequel  it just wasn t the same without spur and harrison  as portrayed by douglas  maybe he recognized how poor the plot was  jim returns after extended absence  to find jessica being pursued by another man  he could not expect any girl to wait that long with no contact from him  and not find competition  for a disney movie  this contains foul language  plus the highly unnecessary part when jim   jessica shacked up without being married  very lame  quite an insult to viewer intelligence  according to members of my family  i ll stick with the first one  and try to forget i ever saw the sequel ',\n  'the original movie  man from snowy river  is one of the best i ve seen  nearly perfect  a lady and the tramp storyline in two senses  rich girl poor boy  and ability vs  bloodline  the sequel  however  is not only a shameless attempt to capitalize on the good name of the original but also a ridiculous  overblown disneyfied mess best summarized as  rambo meets the black stallion   without the charm of the black stallion  the young hero comes back from a 3 year absence  and suddenly he s superman on horseback  in the original  good film  he was real and believable  but sadly reduced to a caricature in the sequel  i ve hardly been as disappointed in a movie  and at times this thing made me quite angry  they missed hardly a cliché  brazen audience manipulation  do studio heads think that all you have to do with a horse loving audience is put pretty horses in front of them  to make them happy  a mess of a movie ',\n  'this film  like the first one   the man from snowy river   has the same good and bad

totally down the tubes in the 1980s  this film  like the first one',\n  'i bought this adaptation because i really liked anne brontë s novel when i read it some time ago and usually particularly enjoy bbc dramas  but i m very disappointed  i never thought it would be as bad as that  the whole series made me laugh much more than moved me as the novel had  br    br   first of all  the music  and songs  seems totally out of place in a period drama  sounds as if it s been written for a contemporary horror film and like another commentator  i was particularly annoyed by the way the cameras spun and spun round the actors  i ve seen some scenes filmed that way in  north and south  and it seemed all right there but in the tenant  it s definitely overdone and simply annoying  camera movements cannot make wooden acting lively  br    br   most of the second roles were difficult to distinguish at first and the script lacked clarity  none of the characters were properly introduced at first  the little boy gave a very good performance  he s very cute and the best feature of the film  br    br   spoilers tara fitzgerald s characterisation of helen graham made her appear cold and harsh  letting no emotion pass through  she doesn t seem to be able to cry at all in a realistic way  i just couldn t believe markham could have fell for her and i m not mentioning the awful hairdo she was given  i could not help feeling some sympathy with her husband  fancy being married to such a virago    besides  he was the only main actor that sounded right to me  toby stephens i found just ok  helen graham s brother not very good   br    br   maybe it s difficult to adapt a novel that deals with such bleak subjects as alcoholism and cruelty  besides  what is only hinted at and left to the reader s imagination in the book is dwelt upon with complaisance in the tv adaptation  making some scenes both gross and comic   like when huntingdon s eye starts bleeding  and others far too sexed up for a period drama  i mean  don t we get enough of those bed scenes in contemporary dramas ',\n  'brilliant book with wonderful characterizations and insights into human nature  particularly the nature of addiction  which still resonate strongly today  br    br   as for the movie    eh  nothing special  the cameraman clearly had an unfortunate addiction to circling and circling and circling around everything  making the viewer quite nauseous  why the director didn t put a stop to this is beyond me  but maybe he was too busy trying  and somehow failing  to draw good performances from these normally excellent but inappropriately cast actors  all in all  a weak adaptation  your three hours would be better spent reading  or re reading  the book ',\n  'before i go on i have to admit to being a huge bon jovi fan  in fact thats what attracted me to the dvd case in the first place  i probably would have bought it anyway being such a big horror fan and having enjoyed the first vampires title so much  br    br   but this isn t half as good  not even jon could save this film for me  my main problem would be that it simply isn t scary  apart from jon s character derek bliss none of the other characters make an impression and you couldn t care less whether they die or not  especially the annoying vampire   drug addict woman  the female vampire simply isn t scary or sexy  rather she looks like an anorexic 14 year girl  no wonder she is so desperate for blood then  another huge problem is that everything is just  too bright   there is no atmosphere or sense of dread  i know the first vampires being set in new mexico wasn t exactly the twilight zone in terms of creepiness but yet it still managed to be dark and foreboding when it needed to be  this film has no tension like that  br    br   the story is basically the same as before  vampire wants berzier s cross to be able to walk in daylight  however the story has less cool bits this time  there is no wow

to the director s commentary confirmed what i had suspected whilst watching the film  this is a movie made by a guy who wants to play at making a movie  the plot is the kind of thing that deluded teenagers churn out when they re going through that  i could write a book screenplay award winning sitcom  phase  there s a germ of an interesting idea buried in there  probably because its a sequel to some one else s movie   but it is totally buried under an underwritten  badly executed and laughably un thought out script  br    br   the lines are dire  and the performances are un engaging  though again  i m inclined to blame the director  he does not appear to have consulted the actors at all about what is required  rather plonked the script in their hands  pointed the camera at them and told them to get on with it  who knows  with a little coaching  these actors could have acquitted themselves better  say what you like about musicians in movies  jon bon jovi was excellent in row your boat and more than acceptable in the leading man   br    br   as it stands  the cast have no chemistry whatsoever  a beautiful opportunity to use the classic sex and vampirism parallel is passed up when  in order to infect bon jovi s character with vampire blood from his ailing co hunter  he is given a transfusion  she should have bitten him  mind you  they should have looked vaguely interested in each other throughout the rest of the film too  the only real moment of sexual tension  between the two female leads  is by the directors own admittance accidental  he had originally intended to use this silent sequence as an excuse for more pointless plot exposition   so  i suppose the finished product could have conceivably been worse  but not a lot  br    br   frankly  as movies go  this is badly plotted  silly and forgettable  even as trashy movies go it s not sexy enough or gory enough to be entertaining  it could have been a fun and bloody little romp  but the director has left with more of a comedy  for all the wrong reasons ',\n  'this is not a good film  the acting is remarkably stiff and unconvincing the film doesn t seem to know whether it is going for a real horror approach or to go down the camp and kitsch route  i never saw the first film but this one doesn t stand up on its own merits  there are several unconvincing plot twists and the viewer is never made aware of the importance of the lead female vampire  not worth the effort of watching',\n  'first of all  jon bon jovi doesn t seem to be in place in a vampire movie  together with the other

 in fact  bon jovi and the two vampire girls  natasha wagner and arly jover probably all fit in the same clothes  in short  it was hard to tell which one was cuter in an anorexic ramp model sort of way  bon jovi has the most charisma  at least he looks happy when he is smiling  the two vampire girls on the other hand are all cramps and complaints  at one point they are about to give each other a wet kiss  but stop  amazing how each vampire movie has some set of morays for the respective vampires  at one point  arly jover is providing fellatio to a very dumb vampire hunter and then she sucks his blood while doing the sex act  it would have been an erotic moment except that it was filmed like a total goof  and the male actor looked mildly amused as he watched arly jover move her head to mimic something that was very obviously not happening  as far as gore is concerned  a few heads are ripped off  and the blood spurts profusely  these scenes have so little suspense or build up that when they happen it is almost funny  and there is no  horror  pay off from the scene  all you get as a member of the audience is a feeling of  wow  that sure was a lot of red paint splattering on the walls  i wonder who has to clean it up   throughout the movie  these vampire hunters who are obviously trying to kill arly jover  the top vampire in the world    keep reaching out to her  at one point  bon jovi goes into the abandoned church and after he just shot her with an arrow  and has done so on other occasions   he says  i am not trying to hurt you  i just want to talk to you  i want to get to know you   huh   of course  the dumb vampire arly jumps out to say hello and bon jovi sticks her again with another impaling device   why can t we be friends  the 1970s hit song by war should have been the theme song for this movie  aside from all of the other silly moments  there is a transfusion sequence when natasha wagner has all her vampire blood removed  and the town people all line up to donate blood for her transfusion  i guess blood type is not important  anyhow  all her vampire blood is removed  bon jovi then decides that if that blood is transfused into him  he can beat arly by becoming a vampire also  of course  as the vampire blood is transfused into him  none of his healthy blood is removed  so apparently bon jovi is walking around with twice as much blood as any human can have in his body  and just like the first vampires  this one also has the vampires bursting into flames special effect ',\n  'thanks for killing the franchise with this turkey  john carpenter and tommy lee wallace  this movie sucks on so many levels it s pathetic  the first vampires was fun  but this low budget retread makes me yawn  br    br   jon bon jovi  the poor man s kevin bacon  drives around mexico with a surfboard housing a hidden compartment holding his vampire killing gear ala antonio banderas s guitar case in desperado  he picks up some lame  hunters  along the way  including an annoyingly feminist infected girl who takes pills to keep from turning into a vampire   and they set out to stop some female master vampire who is given no backstory and so we could care less about her or her quest  to walk in the sunlight by stealing the black cross and performing a ritual to allow her to do so   if you ve seen the first vampires  you ve already seen this  and done much better  br    br   john carpenter has been responsible for a lot of bad movies lately  frankly  i think he s past his prime and incapable of making another horror classic  the only decent film he s done since they live  1987  is vampires  everything else is complete crap  right up until the unbelievably cheap looking and retarded ghosts of mars    and now this waste of celluloid  where are more greats like assault on precinct 13  halloween  1   escape from new york and the thing  br    br   carpenter crony wallace proves he can t write his way out of a paper bag with his paper thin script packed with yawns  groans and recycled gags from the original  did i mention i hated every character in the movie  there was not a single memorable character in the whole film  how does that happen  this film has nothing to recommend it  not even the dvd presentation is good  the menu looks awful  br    br   by comparison  jason x   friday the 13th in space  was a masterpiece  now that is how you make a sequel and  re energize a franchise  ladies and germs  as well as create an exciting dvd menu ',\n  'this  debuted  today on the scifi channel and all i can say is  i am speechless  i taped it today so i could watch it tonight after work  i had high hopes  now i am tearing apart the closets looking for a length of rope so i can hang myself  possibly the worst movie i have ever seen  i wish i could say something nice like  it was fun to make fun of this movie  but this movie is giving me nothing to work with  i know you are not supposed to post spoilers here with out prior warning but i am going to anyway  this movie sucks  there i said it  they should show this flick to film students to show them what not to do  my nine year old niece could make a better film  the only decent thing about this film is the sound and or sound track  oh  i just found a rusty c clamp in my old tool box  i am going to put it on the thumb of my left hand and tighten it until the pain erases the memory of what my eyes have seen  i could just tape over this vhs but i think i will burn it in the fire pit instead  i could wash with soap but i fear i will never be clean again  christmas is coming  buy this movie and give it to people you hate   mike',\n  'this movie is one of the most awful movies ever made how can jon bon jovi play in a movie  he is a singer not an actor  what is he killing vampires with his guitar  and what about the dreadful plot  o my god this movie really sucks  in the end is the queen of vampires played by the eternal vampire arly jover  blade  surrounded by an army of vampires  but when the  fantastic  slayers arrive only 4 vampires are left   what happened with the other 10 15 vampires  they run out in the sun    and what about the  grand finally  when bon jovi blows her head with a shotgun    that s really a  not    in  buffy the vampire slayer  in 100 episodes not a single vampire is killed with a shotgun    this really is a lack of originality ',\n  'this movie was very very mediocre and very very gory  everyone left their acting lessons at home and totally forgot how to act i mean it was so bad and had no real plot and kindergarteners could have written a better story plot wait what story plot  not at all scary ',\n  'the same difficulty i have with the musical version of  les miserables  applies equally to  oliver   instead of the composers  writing in the stylistic period of the play settings  they merely wrote broadway type melodies  which were historically unidiomatic and stylistically skewed  br    br   too  the blatant brutality and unsavory activities of the dramaturgy do not mix well with some of the sunny ditties which permeate the score  it s a uncomfortable mixture that leaves a decidedly sour undertaste  br    br   the casting of the boy oliver doesn t help matters  tentative of timbre and vexingly precious  there s something less than solid here  fagin performs his traditional routine adequately  though the tunes he s obliged to sing have little basis in period manner  br    br    as long as he needs me  is given a strident rendition  throaty and strained  the two big production numbers   who will buy  and  consider yourself  seem over produced  with everything but the kitchen sink thrown in  it s one thing to go all out  yet another to cross over the line into excess   br    br   the gloom  despair and depravity of much of the novel does not seem to lend itself to such ditties and choreography  while the novel is considered a classic  i must confess i have trouble with mr  dickens  consciousness  in that his works tend to emit a negative vibration  this may be due to the extension of his joyless personal life  which was full of disappointment and regret   br    br   not all the combined talent of this production  either on  or behind camera  can overcome the unconstructive nature of the basic material  all this results in an uncomfortably downer experience for me  br    br   ',\n  'the producers made a big mistake casting mark lester  who couldn t act or sing  in the title role  aside from his very bad  acting   all of lester s singing had to be dubbed by a girl  i don t know why they cast him at all  since there would have been so many boys who could have played the part infinitely better and done their own singing as well  shani wallis was far too old to play nancy  who was only supposed to be 16  the current west end version is so much better than the movie in every way  ross mccormack is the best artful dodger of all time and he is certainly far better looking than jack wild ever was  it was clearly political to award this old fashioned musical so many oscars after the tumultuous events of 1968 ',\n  'must every good story be  improved  with added corny broadway music  apparently those who can t come up with their own plots think that classic literature is just there for the plundering  i confess that oliver twist and similar stories are not my favorites  as it is certainly true that dickens often wrote things that leave you considerably bummed out  and this was a great example of just that    so of course  take this serious tale and add nauseating music and camp it up with every character from prancing orphan boys to mincing bobbies and suddenly it s uplifting  argh  fetch me a basin  br    br   the four stars in my rating come from casting  which i could liken to that of my fair lady  each of these films had a cast that a play version could be proud of  but then they must go and have them sing  see complaint above   unlike my fair lady  those singing here could actually do so and they mercifully spared us the singing voice of oliver reed  pardon if i m mistaken  it s been a while   br    br   my biggest complaint i ve stated  why embarrass everyone except the truly shameless by putting silly songs into a perfectly good story  seldom has this been done to good effect  generally it ruins the story  it did with this one  jury s still out on whether this story is worth saving  but with all that gadding about  it s impossible to tell ',\n  'i like musicals but as a dickens fan i hate this one    mild spoilers   starving boys who have enough energy to sing and dance in the workhouse  the poor of london coming out to sing  fagin and dodger walking off into the sunset  not exactly faithful to the novel  as i recall  dodger was publicly hanged and fagin went crazy in prison    end of spoilers   br    br   oliver reed is very weak as sykes  doing little more than growling to indicate his evil  worst however  is mark lester as oliver  who often comes across so awkward and passive you wonder if he s really the main character  his portrayal is in no way helped by the fact that the best they could do when he sings is dub in the voice of a girl  guess they didn t realize that boy trebles can be found in almost every church in england  br    br   self respecting dickens fans  stick to david lean s amazing 1948 film or the bbc 6 hour adaptation from the mid 80 s  avoid this bloated whitewash of a musical ',\n  'well  i saw this movie yesterday and it s   unfortunately   worse than you could think  first of all the plot is idiotic  it has no sense at all  the screenplay is full of intentionally funny dialogues  the audience was laughing many times  and the suspense is very low  actors play so so  with an exception of sharon stone  who has some good moments but also some awfully bad acting moments  the saddest parts are when she tries to be aggressively sexy and says things like  i want to  beep  you   and it looks like  let s say it gently  a very very mature woman acting rude and not sexy at all  that erotic tension from bi1 is totally gone  from the technical point of basic instinct 2 is a mediocre movie   better than typical straight to dvd  but on a far lower lever than the original movie  for instance the scene of crazy joyride is done poorly  the director of basic instinct 2 is no paul verhoeven and it shows  the new composer is no jerry goldsmith and its shows  the script is done by people who are no match for joe eszterhas  there s no substitute for michael douglas in it  the film looks cheap and badly edited at times  i m sorry but my first thought after i left the theater was   why heaven t they made this movie earlier and with original talents behind the success of the first movie   all to all the original movie is like citizen kane compared to this  the first basic instinct is a classic and was a kind of break thru in the popular cinema  it was provoking  sexy and controversial  it had the best sharon stone s performance in her career  it had this specific paul verhoeven s style  unfortunately basic instinct 2 is a unintentionally funny movie  badly directed and a sure razzie award winner in many categories  it s a pity that they made this film ',\n  'it s not like i have overwhelmingly fond memories of verhoeven s original pants down shocker   it always struck me as a glossy  well made airport novel of a movie  thrilling  sexy trash  but trash nonetheless  it was also a film that tapped into a certain sexual zeitgeist  after a decade of anti sex aids induced hysteria  a film about a wildly sexual hotbod who thrill kills to heighten her sexual pleasure was pretty enticing stuff  basic instinct 2 was always going to struggle to provide the same social relevance and immediacy  so the fact that it s desperate attempts at raunchiness are so lame can sort of be overlooked  all it really had to provide was that thin veneer of titillation and a mildly engaging story and all would have been watchable  that it resoundingly fails on so many levels  and in such a way to be a career nadir for everyone involved  is really quite extraordinary to watch  let s state the obvious for starters   sharon stone is too old for the part of sexual magnet catherine trammell  what was so photogenic thru verhoeven s lens looks like mutton dressed as lamb in the hands of gun for hire michael caton jones  who s flat  drab colours and static camera render her undeniable beauty totally moot  i like sharon stone a lot  but if the first film launched her career  bi2 could kill it  she has no chemistry with stuffed shirt david morrissey   their only sex scene is embarrassing too watch  his dough faced mamma s boy of a character made me yearn for the swaggering  orange skin machismo of michael douglas  supporting turns by david thewlis and charlotte rampling waste these fine actors on talky exposition scenes and cliché heavy posturing  and what of the much touted sexual shenanigans  poorly lit  fleetingly glimpsed  as utterly mainstream as an episode of desperate housewives   the european sensibilities that verhoeven brought to the sexual content of the first film are sorely missed  don t watch this film for carnal thrills   there are none and what there is is tragic  the film is  as a whole  convoluted to the point of utter confusion  boring and laughable  the last 40 minutes in particular  where you come to the realisation that the film is  in fact  not going to go anywhere of interest at all  are particularly gruelling and hilarious in equal measure  as a failed sequel  basic instinct 2 will come to occupy similar cinematic ground as exorcist 2 the heretic  beyond the poseidon adventure and xxx2  as a vanity project  it rivals battlefield earth in its misconception  as a multi million dollar piece of hollywood film making  it s a travesty that will be hard to top as the years worst ',\n  'i saw this film at the london premiere  and i have to say   i didn t expect much  but i did expect something that was at least mildly entertaining  br    br   the original  basic instinct  was no great film and is still something of a  smut classic  but it was entertaining  i can recall countless times flipping through channels on tv on a late friday or saturday night having come across the movie and finding myself beginning to actually pay attention to it  br    br   however  this lame brain  waaay belated sequel has nothing  is sharon stone still gorgeous  well  let s put it this way    for a 47 year old  she s pretty hot  is she as beautiful as she was in the original  no  she also has clearly had plastic surgery on her face  and her haircut in this movie is somewhat unappealing  she doesn t look as soft or genuine or innocent as she did in the original    which is sort of the whole point of being an evil seductress  and whatnot  br    br   the rest of the performances range from bad to terrible    and michael caton jones  a typically safe director    one who doesn t always do great work but manages to make worthwhile movies  has officially delivered his first true turkey  a movie so bad people were laughing at certain moments that were intended to be serious  br    br   i hear the film went through multiple editing sessions  and it s very clear from the start  nothing makes much sense  the whole plot is a cosmic mess and the ending    oh my  talk about stupid and unbelievable   still predictable  though   i saw  gigli   i saw  son of the mask     and although i m not looking to  smear  this film  i can say with my own authority  which you don t have to agree with at all  mind you  that i prefer both those films over this catastrophic failure  br    br   by the way  stone left five minutes before the movie began and people in the theater began throwing things at the screen during a particularly outrageous and insulting scene inside an orgy type nightclub  br    br    basic instinct 2     basically  it stinks  too ',\n  'it s been about 14 years since sharon stone awarded viewers a leg crossing that twisted many people s minds  and now  god knows why  she s in the game again   basic instinct 2  is the sequel to the smash hit erotica  basic instinct  featuring a sexy stone and a vulnerable michael douglas  however  fans of the original might not even get close to this one  since  instinct 2  is painful film making  as the mediocre director michael caton jones assassinates the legacy of the first film  br    br   the plot of the movie starts when a car explosion breaks in right at the beginning  catherine tramell  sharon stone  trying to look forcefully sexy  is a suspect and appears to be involved in the murder  a psychiatrist  a horrible david morrisey  is appointed to examine her  but eventually falls for an intimate game of seduction  br    br   and there it is  without no further explanations  the basic force that moves this  instinct   nothing much is explained and we have to sit through a sleazy  c class erotic film  sharon stone stars in her first role where she is most of the time a turn off  part of it because of the amateurish writing  the careless direction  and terrifyingly low chemistry  the movie is full of vulgar dialogues and even more sexuality  a menage a trois scene was cut off so that this wouldn t be rated nc 17  than the first entrance in the series   instinct  is a compelling torture  br    br   to top it off  everything that made the original film a guilty pleasure is not found anywhere in the film  the acting here is really bad  sharon stone has some highlights  but here  she gets extremely obnoxious  david morrisey stars in the worst role of his life  and seems to never make more than two expressions in the movie  confused and aroused   instinct 2  is a horrible way to continue an otherwise original series  that managed to put in thriller with erotica extremely well  paul verhoeven  how i miss you     br    br    basic instinct 2  never sounded like a good movie  and  indeed  it isn t  some films should never get out of paper  and that is the feeling you get after watching this  now  it is much easier to understand why douglas and david cronenberg dropped out  and why sharon stone was expecting a huge paycheck for this           3 10',\n  'it s hard to believe  after waiting 14 years  we wind up with this piece of cinematic garbage  the original was a high impact  dark thriller that achieved  cult  status demonstrating the fine art of cinema as directed by paul verhoeven  this film adds nothing  delivers nothing  and ultimately winds up in the big box of failed sequels  br    br   the opening sequence could have triggered an intriguing set of plot developments using a considerably talented and able cast  unfortunately we are treated to a 90 minute dissertation in the self indulgent life of catherine tramell    or is it sharon stone  possibly a copulation of both  br    br   if the desire is too see a continuation of the sensually provocative stying of sex as in  b s 1   forget it  you wind up with soft porn boredom which ultimately upholds the old adage that a woman can be more alluring in clothes than out of them  it s interesting to note that the wonderful charlotte rampling was romping around in her skivvies  via the 1966 georgy girl  when ms  stone was only 8 years old  a very talented actress and quite adept at holding her own even here  br    br   if you re a true cinema fan then you must see this film and judge it using your own rating system  if not  you might as well wait for the dvd release in the  rated  version   unrated  version   collectors  edition  or  ultimate  version  and perhaps in another 14 years we will be saturated with news of  basic instinct 3  at which point ms  stone will be 62 years old and nobody will really care ',\n  'in my book  basic instinct  was a perfect film  it had outstanding acting on the parts of stone  douglas and all the supporting actors to the tiniest role  it had marvelous photography  music and the noirest noir script ever  all of it adding up to a film that is as good as it will ever get  br    br   this sequel is the exact opposite  it cannot possibly get worse  bad acting and a lame script  combined with totally inept direction  this is really bad  boring  annoying  the only thing that somewhat keeps you concentrated is the relatively short wait for the next scene that is an exact re enacted copy of the original  these copies are so bad they make you laugh and i laughed a lot in spite of myself  because it was like watching the demolishing of a shining monument  the only thing that is good in this horrible mess are the excerpts of the jerry goldsmith score of bi1  michael caton jones and the half wit responsible for the script even included the  there is no smoking in this room  dialog in the interrogation scene and yes she sends her attorney  who is now a solicitor  away   br    br   i am sorry i have seen this awful film that should have never been made  it does damage to the original  so bad is it  the only redeeming value is the realization that cosmetic surgery  and i am sure ms stone afforded the best surgeon money can buy  can do a good job but can obviously not restore the perfection of the original  and what concerns the human body applies to film making  too  there should be a law  don t ever make a sequel to a perfect film ',\n  'the film is pretty confusing and ludicrous  the plot is awful   but on the plus side the acting is pretty good  with a few good shouts and rants  sharon stone is ok this time   not even half as good as the original mind you  the murders aren t as gory as the first one either  which is a shame  its not the unpredictable mess everyone say it is though  the sex is pretty graphic at times while others it is clear it is fake  they are fully clothed   the script is weak most of the time  but the scenes with banter and arguments between dr glass and washburn are highlights  the plot twists a few times  but the ending is awful  the tension is always constant with a huge dollop of  oh my god    the chase sequences are brilliantly directed  and shots and camera angles are impressive and bring a bit of class to an otherwise  rush felt film  sharon stone is a bit old for this too  the bits where we see her breasts were  in the first one  delights  this time around  they are too horrid to describe  the films its self is rather average  but it is worth a go  mainly because the film does deserve some good buzz   with the opening sequence being a highlight  not to be critical  but if you liked the first one   leave this one  don t ruin the run  you ll be glad you left this stone unturned ',\n  'this film is awful  the screenplay is bad  the is script mediocre  and even the sex scenes are worthless  the thrill and intrigue of the original film are completely lacking  this movie was shot in a dark  shadowy and monochromatic style  a la  war of the worlds    which is so disappointing after the beauty of the original film  greg morrisey s brooding character displays one facial expression throughout the film  the twists and turns of the original plot are woefully lacking here  the few that do exist are simply anticlimactic  the only highlight is sharon stone s performance as catherine tramell  faithfully continued in this sequel  but it isn t enough to make up for the other shortcomings  the only circumstance under which a  basic instinct 3  should be made would be if michael douglas agrees to join the cast ',\n  'after eagerly waiting to the end  i have to say i wish i wouldn t have joined the whole series at the first place  the final episode was everything against the previous seven years  it has ruined everything  the journey was 23 years  but captain janeway has the power to reduce it    let say  seven years only  why seven  why not just one  or nothing  why not avoid the whole adventure  crewmemebers were dying all along the journey  why she wants to save seven of nine only  the others don t count or what  the most ridiculous part when the crew states that getting home is not really the most important thing to them  as the say   journey is more important than the destination   unbelievable  and at the finale scene the are surrounded by other federation ships and the earth is in sight  nothing about landing  returning to the normal life  br    br   worst ending ever ',\n  'i sat through almost one episode of this series and just couldn t take anymore  it felt as though i d watched dozens of episodes already  and then it hit me     there s nothing new here  i ve heard that joke on seinfeld  i saw someone fall like that on friends  an episode of happy days had almost the same storyline  ect  none of the actors are interesting here either  some were good on other shows  not here   and others are new to a profession they should have never entered  avoid this stinker ',\n  'i ve been going through the afi s list of the top 100 comedies  and i must say that this is truly one of the worst  not just of the 90 movies on the list i ve seen  but of any movie i ve ever seen  drunks are funny sometimes  dudley isn t  liza almost made it worthwhile  but alas    just go watch arrested development if you want to see her in something good  seriously  dudley laughing and drinking is supposed to be funny  i would highly recommend almost any other movie on the afi s top 100 comedies for more laughs than this  if you want to see a funnier  drunk   try the thin man  funnier movie in general  any marx brothers movie will kill  especially if you re as drunk as arthur  ',\n  'after the superb aankhen 2002  which was a remake of a gujarati

the 40  akshay kumar who acts too funny like a small nerd br    br   the film has a good message how not to spoil your son but sadly the way amitabh wants to make akki responsible is absolutely fake

a highlight  he makes you laugh without overacting and just his presence and his dumb behaviour and deadpan humour he is a riot boman is good in some comic parts but too loud at places priyanka is the heroine so nothing to do  this is her last film with akki so far shefali is awesome though she looks too young for bachchan',\n  'i cannot believe that the indian film industry still puts out such third rate dross as waqt  for starters  the storyline is totally implausible \\x96 spoilt son gets thrown out of family home so as to teach him some self sufficiency  so what does he do  he promptly

secret from the son  but he survives long enough to see his son become famous  to see his new grandson and also make a new toy giraffe with his own hands  br    br   the acting is cringe worthy in its hamminess \\x96 no effort was made to try and act in any convincing manner by any of the main players in this film  as usual for indian films  the family lived in a huge mansion and seemed relatively untouched by the concerns of the real world  br    br   to be honest  the main losers when such dire films are made are the intelligent viewers who made the mistake of seeing such a film  the actors  such as amitabh bachchan and akshay kumar  will still be revered as gods by those people who have nothing but blind faith in bollywood ',\n  'i saw the 7 5 imdb rating on this movie and on the basis of that decided to watch this movie which my roommate had rented  she said she had seen it before   it s funny and sad  i cried the first time i saw it   she gushed  maybe compared to other bollywood movies this deserves a 7 5 out of 10  but in comparison to all the other movies i have seen in my lifetime  this deserves no more than a 3  any movie where i can perpetually guess what is going to happen next is no good for me  the characters are unbelievable  how the act is not realistic at all and their motives are contrived  it is over dramatic and the songs aren t all that great  my biggest problem with bollywood movies is the lack of subtlety  all the emotions are way too overdone and thus not at all realistic  any emotion or bond between characters that is the least bit subtle must be magnified with an unnecessary song  i think i understood that the relationship between the father and son was more like one between friends than one between a parent and child without having to have it conveyed via a five minute long song  the stupid comic relief complete with laugh track was not funny or necessary  we get it  laxman isn t the sharpest tool in the shed   if a movie tries to elicit tears through the most hackneyed means possible it just isn t meaningful  just a bit embarrassing  br    br        spoiler      br    br   generally if someone has terminal stage lung cancer their son who lives with them would know something was wrong without having to be told  too many plot holes to count  at first the movie was amusing and cute in the way bollywood movies are to people who don t watch them that avidly but it just got tedious  it takes a lot of skill to make a movie that is amusing and heartwrenching and the best way to do it is usually not having all the amusing parts in the first half of the movie and all the heartwrenching parts at the end  br    br        spoiler over      perhaps it had a very little more depth than other bollywood movies that i have seen  but not much at all  i spent more time laughing at the stupidity of the movie than the parts that were supposed to be funny  i didn t shed a single tear nor did i feel like it  rather i was overwhelmed with a feeling of disgust at the attempt at a dramatic ending  i don t recommend this movie if you want to watch something good  i recommend it if you want to watch a bollywood movie that is kind of sad ',\n  'this movie s full title is  waqt  race against time   that s a race no one can ever win  but you can certainly cut your losing margin by not wasting any of your precious  waqt  on this bakvaas  this movie was clumsy and manipulative in a way that made k3g look honest  it strained my credulity too far  it was ridiculously stupid in its storyline  and deserves to be mocked for it  br    br   it s not quite as awful as baghban or black  but this movie has nothing to recommend it  stupid  pointless  with a ridiculously ott performance by amitji  the central  plot  is another nasty example of the crudely manipulative propaganda that infests so many  family  bw films  if my father  who raised me  and who i love dearly  treated me like big b did akshay  i d shoot him myself  to say nothing of the trivialising of terminal illness ',\n  'those 2 points are dedicated the reasonable performance from akshay kumar  i know bollywood films do not really strive to be realistic but please a walt disney production is more realistic than this plot  the father is dying and does what any good parent does   kick his son out the son with his pregnant wife  a few things that were too hard to swallow  1  priyanka  cool indoor swimming pool in the bedroom  and to go from that to living hungry in her in laws garden shed         2  akshay suddenly got the job as a stunt man  gets bitten by rabified dogs  to then just walk off  this film is an insult to our intelligence i really cant believe i contributed financially to the  people  who made this film by taking my family to see it  we left the cinema with a frown  please do not subject yourself to this mess to watching this take my advice and do not waste your  waqt  ',\n  'this is just usual indian garbage that gets turned out as cinema  as indians we can proudly boast that we have the biggest cinema industry  however it also the worst  br    br   how can other poor countries have films with real characters that challenge the views of their respective societies and we just keep on pumping out garbage  take a look at russia  iran  china and latin america  look at the brilliant films they have and we get crap like kisna   br    br   get real people  no wonder the international community in general laughs at indian cinema ',\n  'pros  akshay kumar s performance is it just me or does this guy always manages to trump ab in their movies together    some touching scenes in the 2nd half  br    br   cons  the whole 1st hour the jokes were flat to say the least   every scene involving rajpal yadav  major stupidity in ab s decision making  let me get this straight  he believes brutally insulting his son s soul in every possible way that will likely ruin their relationship beyond repair  is a better way for him to make akshay finally take some responsibility then actually telling him the truth   wtf  he considers akshaye is too soft to bear the fact that his old father is soon gonna die due to cancer  but thinks insulting him will make him stronger  am i the only one who doesn t see the logic here  easily the movie s biggest flaw  br    br     akshay becoming a stunt man  lmao   we re told he finished 1st in college every year and has a degree in mba  but when the time arrives to support himself  and his pregnant wife  he becomes a stunt man  lol   how abt actually applying for a normal job in ur field  or heck  anywhere else where ur life isn t in danger  this is some incredibly dumb writing  br    br     the ending  i hate this sort of melodramatic crap  everything is pushed down our throats to feel sorry for ab s character  which i couldn t  the entire thing reminded me a little too much of srk in khnh which i hate   this  please feel sorry for the guy with the illness  crap has run its course  i felt more like puking than sympathy for the old man  couldn t watch the final 20 or so minutes because of it and thus had to fast fwd  the whole thing  br    br   bottomline  waqt is just too dumb to be called a good movie  its obvious director vipul shah targeted this at the emotionally fragile chicas and oldies who could care less about a story that actually makes sense  give  em some decent song picturizations  fancy outfits  plenty of glycerin filled scenes and some star power and they ll happily lap up crap like this ',\n  'well well one cant b wasting time just cause of a big star cast   i think all i could see is a bunch of talents wasting their time on a big screen with some pathetic humor which will appeal to i do not know who  some pathetic songs that will be heard by who  some pathetically abrupt turnings justified by who  race against time  u mean waste against time  ok so first you spoil your kid then you teach him a lesson wow we are so ignorant of this fact whoever said its a brilliant new concept probably is some other species other than human alright fine let me come comment like humans do movie has a nice message to be given but it could well have been given by a stranger sitting besides you in the bus rather than you going for such a wasteful movie to learn it hindi movies have proved it a lot already and also i cant waste my time writing about waste anyway ',\n  'first of all there is gujarati theatre then there is bollywood  both have their strengths and fan following  director vipul shah should look elsewhere instead of gujarati theatre when making a bollywood production  first he made aankhen  adapted from a gujarati play    which had a unique plot  but could not hold as a hindi film  now he s adapted another gujarati play and named it waqt   a race against time  in sum  the emotions are alien  the plot development is not for hindi films  for example  the role play between father and son is best left to gujarati theatre   don t bring it in a hindi film  even the comedy track is best left for the gujarati stage  all performances are average   nothing to shout about   barring shefali chhaya shah who is fantastic ',\n  'i found this film to be quite an oddity  from the very get go i found it extremely hard to like this movie  and now after a little thinking about it i can pretty much pinpoint the reason why  jean marc barr  although i love him to bits  i think zentropa is one of the best movies ever made  is quite miscast here  and although i can t figure for the life of me who would be better  i am sure someone could have taken his place quite easily and make this film work  everything else is fine  except for the stabs at weak comedy  a meet the parents joke is not really needed  filmmakers   and i really like richard e  grant as the british major  it just suffers from one thing   jean marc ',\n  'all for love   as it titled when it was broadcast at the weekend   is a romantic period drama featuring captain saint ives a french officer in napoleon s army who is captured by the british and imprisoned in scotland where he meets and falls in love with a young maiden who visits the prison   there s also a storyline involving a murder   br    br   i will be honest and confess that i wasn t too taken by the movie since i m not much of a fan of period dramas and the screenplay feels somewhat episodic but i will say that this is well acted by everyone involved and it s got a good cast that features miranda richardson   anna friel   richard e grant   michael gough and jason isaacs   the costume design as you can expect is also excellent  br    br   i ll be very surprised if this movie doesn t get any complaints after being broadcast on bbc2 at teatime   captain saint ives lies in bed with a prostitute where a nipple is fully exposed and there s a scene of french prisoners bathing that includes full frontal male nudity not to mention a murder scene where blood is clearly seen   you really do have to worry if bbc schedulers have any type of clue as to what they re doing',\n  'around the late 1970 s  animator don bluth  frustrated with the output his company  disney was churning  defected from the mouse house to form his own studio  his first production  the secret of nimh  was a brilliant feature that still holds up well to this day  this was followed by an american tail and the land before time  both of which were made under the involvement of steven spielberg and were commercially successful  although none of those two films had the dark adult appeal of nimh  they still are very charming  enjoyable features for both children and grown ups  but before long  don bluth had his first major misfire with all dogs go to heaven  critics were especially harsh on this film  and matters weren t helped by the fact that it opened alongside disney s the little mermaid  br    br   considering that the movie has such a friendly sounding title  one would expect all dogs go to heaven to be pleasant family fare  instead bluth provides a surprisingly dark story involving gambling  deceit  crime  mistreatment  and murder  that itself is not a problem for an animated feature per say  but it does call into question over whether the film is for children  on the other hand  it s hard to say whether adults will find much to enjoy in all dogs go to heaven  in short  it s a movie with a major identity crisis  br    br   set in a dreary junkyard of new orleans  the movie starts out when charlie b  barkin  a rough and tumble german shepherd  is run over by a car courtesy of his former gambling casino partner  a nasty  cigar puffing pitbull  carface  before you know it  charlie finds himself in heaven  albeit by default  here a whippet angel  annabelle  tells him that  all dogs go to heaven because unlike people  dogs are usually loyal and kind   this line represents the confused nature of the movie  since the dogs in the movie  the whippet aside  are presented as anything but  br    br   upon realizing that he s been murdered  charlie steals his way back to earth and plots to get even with carface  with the reluctant help of his dachshund pal itchy  charlie  rescues  carface s prize  annemarie  a human girl who can talk to animals  in order to predict who will win the rat races   charlie claims that he will help the little cutie find her a family  but in reality he is using her skills to win fortunes at the race so that he can build a more elaborate casino of his own to bring carface down  although he refuses to admit it  charlie does grow to love annemarie    br    br   the concept of the story isn t as problematic as the execution  aside from the human girl annemarie and a flamboyant musical alligator who appears about three quarters through  with the vocal pipes of ken page   none of the other characters emerge as likable  nor frankly  are even worth caring about  unfortunately  that also applies to charlie  in trying to make him an anti hero  the script  composed by more than ten writers  only succeeds in rendering the character too unlovable  as such  the audience feels no empathy for charlie  and worse  his redemption at the end of the movie does not come across as convincing   further damaging to the character is the disappointingly uncharismatic vocal performance from burt reynolds   besides the lack of an endearing lead  the movie s other problem is in the structure of the story  the slowly paced plot jumps all over the place and makes a habit of throwing in extra scenes which serve no purpose but to pad out the movie s running time  the aforementioned musical alligator  who resides in a danky sewer infested with native rats  seems to have been thrown in from nowhere  as does a scene where charlie tries to show his generosity to annemarie by feeding a pack of pastel colored pups pizza  the whole screenplay feels like a rough first draft  a bit more polish could have made this a tighter  impactful story  br    br   matters are not helped by the lackluster musical numbers by charlie strouse and t j  kuenster  annemarie s song and the gator s ballad are the only good ones  the latter in particular benefits from ken page s mellifluous vocal  or the uneven voice cast  as mentioned  burt reynolds  stiff and lifeless charlie detracts from his already unlikeable character even further  the only exception is a fiery confession to itchy about his true intentions toward the end   dom deluise as itchy is pretty good  but he s had better roles  notably tiger in an american tail and jeremy in the secret of nimh  ken page  as mentioned  is awesome in anything he does  but his character has such a small part that his overall contribution is unremarkable at best  similarly wasted are loni anderson  as a collie who once sired a litter with charlie   melba moore  and charles nelson reilly  judith barsi as annemarie is probably the only voice that comes across as truly memorable  partially because her character is the sole legitimately likable one in this depressing and joyless show  br    br   barsi aside  the only real positive about all dogs go to heaven is the animation  technically  this film has some of the most imaginative visuals from bluth s team  by 1980 s standards  that is   particularly a frightening scene where charlie has a nightmare about ending up in a fiery underworld ruled by a gargantuan satanic canine demon  if anything  the movie is more of a triumph of animation than storytelling  br    br   on the whole  however  i cannot recommend all dogs go to heaven as good entertainment  even though i recognize that the movie has its fans and the climax does admittingly provide some energy and a moving conclusion  the overall package is not in the same league as bluth s better efforts  animation buffs will marvel at the lush artistry  but by the time it s over  all dogs go to heaven could very well leave a bad taste in your mouth ',\n  'wow  what a waste of acting talent  my husband and i sat there  both thinking  this has to get better  these actresses are too good to have wasted their time on this crap  unattractive characters  hackneyed script  and listless pacing make for a long two hours  i actually couldn t hack it and left to do the grocery shopping  cat litter being more appealing than this film   the husband stayed and confirmed that it didn t get better  by the time buddy is killed  you were wishing they all would get hit by a car and end their miserable lives  it would be infinitely more entertaining  beautiful scenery and costumes can t keep this one alive ',\n  'i went to see  evening  because of the cast  i d gone to see  norman s room  for that reason    that movie offering diane keaton  leonardo de caprio and  also  meryl streep    and had loved every minute of it  same for  the notebook  even though it was chick flit lite  and my feeling was  anything offering performances by vanessa redgrave  meryl streep  patrick wilson and glenn close would be at least as good  instead  i found sometimes even the greatest actors cannot overcome trite  simplistic and    on one occasion    truly offensive material  br    br   now i had no problem with the way the film was structured  i actually enjoy movies that cut back and forth in time to tell a story   so long as one era illuminates the other and vise verse  but while vanessa s character being on her deathbed and recalling a past event she felt  was a mistake  was riveting  at times  the part actually showing what that  past mistake  was does nothing to clarify the matter  in fact  it makes it seem meaningless in the silliest  girl meets boy  girl gets boy  girl loses boy  fashion  and in the most unbelievable  clichéd  wrong headed way possible  br    br   and from here be spoilers  so bear that in mind should you continue reading  br    br   first of all  claire danes was brutally miscast  not only does she not even begin to resemble vanessa redgrave as a young woman  she has nowhere near the chops when it comes to acting  don t get me wrong  she can be good in the right role    just not this one  and patrick wilson was miscast  though he has the acting chops to almost pull it off  he d have been better suited to the part hugh dancy played    the rich confused wasp    and not the object of sexual attraction to one and all  he s a bit too wasp y for that  hugh dancy  one note     i m a tortured drunk and wait till you find out why   and the  why   i m a closet case in a sexually repressed world  so i have to drink to excess and make a fool of myself in front of everyone i know  was so offensive to me and the manner in which he died  as you knew he would because that s the only thing that can happen to a faggot in the fifties  so ludicrous  wrong headed and mishandled  i nearly threw my candy at the screen  br    br   as for the modern part between toni collette and her sister  her fear of commitment  her jealousy of her sister s  perfect life   her sister wondering if she s made the right choices  her pregnancy and her too perfect boyfriend  which actually might have been more interesting and meaningful if played by patrick wilson  and ebon moss bachrach might have been a more interesting harris  given his dreamy eyes     anyway  all this was hashed over in the 70 s and 80 s  and in much greater depth  do we really have to present it  again  and all as if it was fresh and momentous  br    br   and to top it off  meryl streep doesn t even appear until the last ten minutes of the movie  all in old lady makeup that hides many of her facial expressions  she s still good  but only because she s meryl  and meryl can find a way to pull off even the silliest dialog under the heaviest of makeup  br    br   so to put it simply  this movie has every cliché in the  really meaningful message  movie book  and it adds a few that really had no business being trotted out  again  at two hours long and laced with  lifetime movie of the week  music that is guaranteed to rub you raw  it s a complete failure in both the  meaningful  and  moviemaking  aspects  i give it  3  only because of meryl and vanessa  br    br   now  if all you require from your films is twadd le  then please set my comments about  evening  aside and have the time of your life  but if you want a truly meaningful experience being served up by great actors and filmmakers who know what to do with a simple story about life and death and all the nonsense it brings  rent  norman s room  and find out what truly great acting is ',\n  'the story of a woman  ann  on her death bed  her two daughters  nina and constance  and her thoughts about her past  the flashbacks are concerning a weekend where young ann is in the wedding of her friend lila  at the wedding she meets harris who will impact her for the rest of her life  through all the ups and downs of her professional and family life she remembers him as her true love  her daughter constance is older  more  responsible   a mother of two and has things together  nina jumps from boyfriend to boyfriend and job to job and is unsure of her direction in life  br    br   first of all the good  the period detail in the movie is great  the dresses  hair  cars  houses  etc  really put you in another time and place  and there is some very quality acting in the movie  vanessa redgrave is quite good at portraying the main character and her fragile mental state as her life comes to an end  claire danes is beautiful and does a great job as the main character when she was young  and she is an outstanding singer   hugh dancy brought a lot of life to the character of lila s brother buddy  br    br   now for the bad  which unfortunately is everything else  things constantly disrupt the story as it is being unfolded for us  the chemistry between young ann and buddy is great  they have fun and dance  then    you are supposed to believe that she doesn t really like him more than a friend and that his pining only annoys her  and i thought the whole   he might be gay  thing was out of the blue and didn t serve a purpose  br    br   then we have harris  the character acts wooden and creepy  had this been another genre  you would have known that harris was the serial killer from the get go  it is an unbelievable stretch to think that all these girls loved him so  but they do portray the other guys as pretty lame to try and help him out   br    br   and the grandest problem of all  why don t ann and harris get together  they fall for each other  they have this great night of sex in an old dirty gardener s shack  come home to find out about buddy s tragic end and then    br    br   nothing  br    br   they meet up a few years later and get all misty eyed about each other and i couldn t help but wondering why  why  the movie doesn t let you know why they were forced to marry other people and so i had a hard time feeling sorry for them  br    br   the part of the story in the present is fairly boring  the cliché good daughter and the cliché bad daughter  nina changes over the course of the movie but i am not sure why  i m not sure what convinces her to change her life  there is a  touching  scene where the daughters are connecting that coincides with old ann dreaming she s chasing a butterfly  it is really lame and embarrassing  br    br    there are no mistakes   ann advises at us  the statement doesn t ring true with the story  and it doesn t ring true after seeing the movie and wishing they hadn t wasted the talent of such good actors ',\n  'some of these viewer comments are just ridiculous  not painful to watch with your significant other  i was apologizing to my boyfriend the entire movie   br    br   it was so slow and awfully strange   br    br   both redgraves vanessa and natasha were unfit for this  especially with vanessa doing that ridiculous brash american accent   br    br   claire danes was the same wiggly lipped awkward girl that she was in my so called life  she has yet to push herself in any way  girl  find a new way to pretend to cry   br    br   meryl streep was one of the only redeeming part of this movie  she was on screen for five minutes  and i swear to god  she reached out of the movie screen and slapped me awake   br    br   oh  and hugh dancy  who gets better every time i see him   br    br   glenn close and eileen atkins were also great in their two and a half scenes   br    br   i mean  this was a well shot movie  it was very pretty  the settings were interestingly dressed  providing relief for the intense boredom i was feeling   br    br   i don t know  it s just pretty pathetic when a movie that boasts a cast comprised of  the greatest actresses of our time  sucks so much  it sure had more than a few noticeable editing errors  and the main character  ann  was a huge jerk  i was glad she died  but that s because i felt bad for lila  ann s friend    mostly because these two ladies were better actors and made me feel a little empathy   br    br   ugh  bad job  evening the film  you weren t entertaining and you weren t even thought provoking  i sure hope the book was better  so it didn t waste even more of people s time  3 10',\n  'this crap is like watching paint dry  i m so disappointed because i was so eager to see it  br    br   there simply is no meaning to this film  if it were never made  no one would notice or care  it s hyped up because of all the big names in it  but if  nobody s  were in  nobody would give this film any love  br    br   seriously  i was at the point where half way through the film i would look at vanessa redgrave and think   hurry up and die already   this is like the  joy luck club  without any of the friggin  joy  it s the  ocean s 13   nothing but a big named cast  of mother daughter movies and completely anti climatic   oh until it s finally over  br    br   i m sure they ll all be nominated for oscars    br    br     4 stars for cinematography and the ability to convince great actresses to commit to this junk ',\n  'i knew that  evening  was a girlie film  so i was expecting to be bored  a wicked tease on imdb had said that it was a  chick flick  but that your companion would survive  br    br   survive  yes  i am still here  but when the two of us came out we were amazed to find that it had only lasted two hours   it seemed a much longer evening than that  i suppose that  for yanks  it is supposed to be elevating or fascinating because it is about rich people living on the beach   well  next to the beach  in a house with a wide verandah and a lawn but no apparent lawnmower  if that sort of thing impresses you it might seem quite a short film  br    br   there s a monty python film about a knight who just won t die  he ends up a wriggling  why do yanks add an third syllable to this word i wonder  torso in the road still shouting threats at his nemesis  this film is also about a sort of living dead  vanessa redgrave  inappropriate name for the grave dodger shown here  goes on and on dying whilst having inappropriate guilt  she s not worried about having been a wide eyed  breathless bimbo  but imagines herself a murderess  br    br   obviously  being a girlie film  there s a chap who is supposed to be the mr darcy heathcliff character  i m not a woofter  so i can t claim to be a good judge of such things  but the tedious wimp who is wheeled out for this role seems only to have the title of servant in his favour  he s a bloodless cypher  br    br   as you might gather  the main characters aren t much cop  but the minor ones manage  amazingly to be much worse  there s a fellow whose only job is to react to the news that his girlfriend is preggers  fair enough  but it isn t the role of hamlet   why ham it up so badly  forgetting that it was a girlie film  i thought he was going to be thrown out because any decent girl friend would have told him that face fungus didn t flatter him  but then i realised that she must have encouraged him to grow a  beard  because he looked worse without it  br    br   i kept awake by noticing which actors and actresses had their earlobes attached or free and noting interesting bits of scenery   if you re dragged along to it  see if you can spot the stuffed buffalo head  just the sort of thing you d expect in a beach cottage  br    br   apart from the obligatory wedding  there is only one piece of action  you d have thought that they d have got it right  sadly  though  the hit and run accident is carried out by a car that couldn t be there  when the accident is discovered the cast wander about shouting for a character that they can t know is nearby  but we do as the audience   if they don t have any clue that the person is within a couple of miles of the place  then why do they wander about aimlessly shouting for him  i suppose that the director s excuse is that it is supposed to be a half remembered dream sequence    br    br   another scenery item that caught my attention was a copper bottomed saucepan  i didn t think that the technology to do this was developed until the fifties ',\n  'just ppv d this  i don t want to waste too much time on this as most of the posters here put it better than i ever could  but i did want to say a few things  br    br   i didn t know which was funnier  redgrave chasing tiny moths and tripping over her nurse  close wailing that her  precious  boy  whom she and the mr  had decided was a drunken loser  has been turned into roadkill  that the tone deaf ann schmoozed with peggy lee  or the horrid cgi of crypt keeper annie gazing at her younger self  br    br   i never bought danes as the younger redgrave  i didn t buy richardson and collette as sisters  either  if meryl streep s daughter wants to be an actress  she better get mama to give her a few lessons  i had zero idea why any girl  or buddy  would make fools of themselves over vapid stud du jour harris  ann s daughters are as whiny and thoughtless as she  luc is a retarded slacker on crack  and i didn t give a rot about any of them  evening gives chick flicks a bad name ',\n  'with a cast list like this one  i expected far better  venessa redgrave spent the majority of the movie lying in bed  the best actresses in the world cannot make anything very interesting when their acting is limited to lying down and falling asleep throughout the entire movie  the plot summary says that a secret is revealed to the daughters as their mother comes closer to death  the thing is  she never tells her daughters anything except cryptic advice to be happy  all the relationships in the movie are underdeveloped  i also felt that the back and forth between the past and present was unnecessary  it seemed as if the idea was stolen either from the book the da vinci code in which the device was used to increase suspense  or from the notebook in which they used the device to create the never ending romance of the story s main characters  either way it was a cheap device in this movie because it didn t work to create anything  it was a way to attempt suspense in a movie that has none  i left wondering why good movies can t be written for women  it really was a disappointment ',\n  'i saw this in a sneak two days before the official opening  and i must say i was extremely disappointed  and i have to put the majority of these problems on the decision to cast claire danes in the lead role  depending on what you think about danes  she was either horribly miscast  or is so far in over her head that she should be the early favorite for the 2007 razzie for worst actress  i think we were supposed to be sympathetic to her  instead  she is completely unlikeable  the other  great  actresses do an ok job  but certainly don t light up the screen  out of all the  great  actresses in this movie  i d say the one who did the best job was natasha richardson  streep is barely in the picture  and only appears near the very end  br    br   horrible screenplay as well  it comes off more as them reading lines than truly being  in character  ',\n  'this is  without a doubt  the most offensive  chick flick  i have seen in years  if not ever  the writing   characterizations are so riddled with stereotypes that the film verges on parody  before walking out of the theater an hour and five minutes into this disaster  we were subjected to the following themes  having a baby will solve all of your problems   performer types  are miserable messes    musicians can t be good mothers unless they toss their dreams for a more conventional lifestyle  what a waste of a talented cast   some great looking sets   costumes  when natasha richardson told toni collette that unless she lives a more mainstream life  she ll end up   shudder    alone    i felt queasy  i can t believe this movie made it to theatrical release  it s the sort of fare one expects from those  women s  cable channels that i always pass right by when channel surfing  i am female and over 35  so i should be part of this film s target audience  but boy  does  evening  miss its target ',\n  'i never expect a film adaptation to follow too closely to the novel  especially a beloved one  like evening  but when i saw that the book s author  susan minot  was a screenplay writer and executive producer on the film  i thought that evening would be a good adaptation  br    br   if you enjoyed the book  don t bother with this movie  it is so far afield of the book that the two hardly bear any resemblance to one another  br    br   here  our characters are completely different  the bride is in love with harris  harris is the son of the housekeeper  buddy is a drunk  in love with ann and or harris  i don t think a single character made it from the book to the screen  oh it just gets worst with every passing moment  br    br   and  really  didn t we learn from bridges of madison county that cutting from the story we are meant to be enthralled in  to scenes of our heroes  grown children having obnoxious and juvenile fights  simply does not work on film  this film is a disaster  skip it ',\n  'cast to die for in a movie that is considerably less  vanessa redgrave is dying but before she goes she begins to tell her daughters the story of her life and of her secret love    br    br   this is one of those movies which has the look and expectations of being a great film simply because they have so many great actors and actresses in it so it seems to be about something other than the potboiler that it really is  not bad as such but with redgrave  toni collette  glenn close  meryl streep  clare danes natasha richardson eileen atkins  patrick wilson hugh darcy and others  all giving fine performances  you expect more than a weepy story thats a bit more than a harlequin romance  br    br   wait for cable ',\n  'almost as tedious to watch as it was to read  evening is a gorgeously produced failure   until meryl streep walks in and quietly shows her other cast members how to act this kind of stuff  vanessa redgrave is shockingly off in her role as the dying ann and claire danes is a cipher  perhaps if vanessa and claire had switched roles we could have seen the vibrancy in the young ann that gave her entrée to the rarefied world of the story and we could have imagined that the older ann actually was dying   br    br   i was hoping the addition of michael cunningham to the writing credits would smooth out the jumpy storytelling but alas  it gave me a headache ',\n  'i looked over the other comments and was thoroughly amused to find that clearly only people who actually worked on the movie had commented  i mean  i hate to say bad things about an amateur production  but if you make a bad movie and want to comment on it  tone it down a little   groundbreaking  is a little over the top  this is a boston based college production that doesn t even achieve the level of most amateur college film  it s what you would expect a bunch of kids to do  a silly action film without much creativity  it s pretty funny if you re willing to poke fun at it  not something you will ever see unless you are a student at emerson college ',\n  ' the 40 year old virgin  exists in a world i don t understand  a world where an electronics store

peoples  cars  a world where it seems okay for a boss to sexually harass her underlings  a world full of raging and offensive stereotypes of ethnic minorities  and a world without any funny jokes  i am absolutely shocked at the seeming chorus of viewers who liked this movie  i thought every scene was like a bad saturday night live sketch   not very funny to begin with  and stretched out beyond all rational thought  the chest waxing scene went on forever  br    br   the characters  aside from carell  were totally one note  and the romantic elements were completely contrived  particularly the scene where keener finds porn in carell s apartment  that was just lame  br    br   and i also found the  aquarius  sequence totally annoying and excessive  i hated hated hated this movie ',\n  'it is amazing to me what passes for entertainment today  maybe i am a dinosaur from the fifties  and i am out of touch with todays movie going generation  and apparently that is the case with regards to this movie  since so many people loved it  i found it foul and vulgar  i haven t said that about many movies in my life but this one fits the bill  the humor is sophomoric and crude  i am not a politically correct person  and even i found the gay jokes  not only not funny but downright offensive   i m not gay   the main character in the movie is not even a likable person  just pathetic  when the movie was finally over i heard a number of people comment on how disappointed they were in what they had just pay good money to see ',\n  'about 15 minutes in  my wife was already wanting to leave

this would let up  very rare   we d sit back and watch  not laughing  mind you  and wait for the next gross out or offensive remark s   after about 35 minutes  we both got up and left  everything we d read said how great this was  the trailer looked good and roger ebert actually called it  intelligent  and said it wasn t a crude sex comedy  did he go to the right movie  along with be cool  it s the only other movie i ve ever walked out on   and i have no regrets  i m sick of trying to go see comedies in america ',\n  'wow  this film is truly awful  i can t imagine how anyone could have read this badly written script and given it the greenlight  the cast is uniformly second rate with some truly horrendous performances from virtually all of the cast  the story is disjointed  fragmented and incoherent  the telling  leaden and predictable  no wit  no charm  no humour  not sexy in the least  the characters remain as flat as the proverbial pancake  there s also a strong current of misogyny which became increasingly hard to stomach as the film went on  when your lead  carrell  is unfunny and unappealing it s uphill from there  despite it s phony turn around ending where love triumphs over lust i was left with a sick feeling in my stomach  if this is what passes for humour and social comment then we re definitely doomed ',\n  'after we counted the use of the f word  oh  about 22 times in the first 10 minutes or so of the film  listened to some really bad actors going on about a woman and a horse  and pretty much acting like 12 year old boys being naughty together  well  we turned it off  relying on gratuitous profanity and potty humor is a sure sign of a loser hollywood movie  the product of unimaginative and no talent writers   br    br   we did give it a second chance  thinking surely it would get better  no dice  later  my boyfriend skipped through the rest of the movie in case it improved  still no dice  br    br   the main character did have a cool bike  br

miss the bit about him being comatose for 20 years  br    br   one of a series of films where 40 somethings act like teenagers and women for some reason find this a sufficiently attractive quality

the others the better  br    br    it is a mystery why lugosi accepted parts in independent quickies at this stage of his career  because he was still a bankable star at universal at this time  maybe it was because in this case he got to play the hero and get the girl  who knows  as his career started to spiral downwards in the late 30s  this kind of fare would become the norm for lugosi rather

to do so one of the first films to be quickly hidden away would undoubtedly be  stroker ace   this film is awful with a capital  a   it is the worst film burt reynolds ever starred in     quite a feat

actually feel pity for the actors playing them  anderson especially is saddled with such a dumb role that it makes you grind your teeth with despair  the humour is weak and infantile throughout  and the stunts and race sequences are unremarkable  even the out takes during the closing credits  which can be found in all the reynolds needham collaborations  are generally unfunny  which gives the impression that maybe the film wasn t much fun to make   stroker ace  is a stinker of considerable magnitude ',\n  'this should not have been listed as a colombo because in my opinion it does not resemble any of the other colombo ever made  this should have been listed as a movie starring peter falk and not playing the caracter of colombo because it does not do justice at all to our great lieutenant colombo ',\n  'whenever a columbo story deviates from the familiar plot  colorful killer commits crime  columbo smokes out killer  columbo becomes a pest in the process   the writers somehow are never able to match the quality and interest of most traditional episodes  this episode deviates in the extreme  and the result is a major flop  br    br    would you believe  columbo never faces the villain till the very end    br    br   frankly  i was tempted to turn it off about two thirds through  br    br    oh  the sacrifices we self appointed reviewers make   ',\n  'seriously what were they thinking  over the course of years the columbo series has tried out some new things and diverted away from the usual successful formula but this movie really overdoes it  this movie is basically very different from any other columbo movie but the differences are not for the good of the movie  br    br   main thing that of course makes this movie different from any other columbo movie is the fact that there is no murder being committed  the entire premise of this movie is totally different and it places the columbo character in a totally different environment and situation  also the overall is just totally different and more  modernized   br    br   director alan j  levi did some other columbo movies in the past  which all very much sticked to the usual formula  it also makes it an odd choice that he got picked to direct this movie  br    br   the columbo character himself also feels quite different  perhaps because of the reason that he gets placed in a totally different environment and situation  when he helps out his nephew after his bride disappeared right after the wedding  the absence of some good relieving and trademark columbo humor also doesn t exactly make this a good or enjoyable watch  br    br   in all honesty  the movie doesn t begin too bad but the movie starts to become more and more ridicules with its story as it progresses  it s such a stupid written kidnap thriller with a story that starts to become more and more unlikely  it also makes the movie more and more unwatchable  this is a very little interesting columbo entry that also really doesn t know to entertain its viewers in any way  br    br   it also doesn t help much that the supporting actors aren t the most talented ones around  despite the fact that his character is put in such a totally different situation and the movie is shot in such a completely different style  peter falk still holds up well and his presence still somewhat saves this movie  can you just imaging how this movie would had been without him  it would had been an extremely bad and ridicules cheap movie i can tell you  br    br   an odd columbo entry  which could be described as a failed experiment to divert from the usual formula  br    br   4 10',\n  'the script for this columbo film seemed to be pulled right out of a sappy 1980 s soap opera  deeply character driven films are great  but only if the characters are compelling  and in this film the only thing compelling was my desire to change the channel  the villain s dialog sounds as if it were written by a romance novelist  the great lt  columbo himself is no where near his famous  lovable  self effacing  crumpled self  and the bride kidnap victim is a whimpering  one dimensional damsel in distress  she cowers in fear from a tiny scalpel held flimsily in the hand of her abductor   come on    i could have knocked the scalpel out of his hand and kicked him in the you know what in 2 seconds   in any sense of reality  this character would have at least tried to struggle or fight back at least a little  and speaking of reality    the story revolves around a kidnapping which is worked and solved by the police  the police   give me a break  everyone knows the fbi takes over every kidnapping case  this was no columbo  just a shallow and totally predictable crime drama with our familiar lt  columbo written in and stretched to 2 hours ',\n  'i love columbo and have seen pretty much all of the episodes but this one undoubtedly ranks as the worst of the lot  a mind bogglingly tedious  pointless  muddled pile of unwatchable drivel that wastes both the time of the viewing audience and of the acting talents of an exceedingly bored looking peter falk  the  plot   such as it is  just seems to be made up as the film goes along with not even the slightest hint of the ingredients to the formula that made the show such a brilliant success to start with  one part of the proceedings which i found extremely puzzling   or possibly annoying   was peter falk s character being introduced to the guests at the wedding as  lt  columbo  if the producers insist on keeping columbo s first name a secret  why couldn t they have omitted this line altogether as it sounds ridiculous  like i said  this is the pits and all true columbo fans would do well to avoid it like the plague ',\n  'loyalty to peter falk is all that kept me from giving this awful picture the  1  it deserved   for that matter  loyalty to mr  falk was what kept me watching this film all the way from heads to tails   even if you forgive all the glaring errors  this was just plain the poorest excuse for a made for tv  columbo  film ever  i m glad i watched it on tv for free  would have hated to have coughed up the bucks for a print ',\n  'absolute garbage  the reason that this is so terrible is not because it deviated from the formula  but because the plot was just pathetic   br    br   the supposed star didn t do anything to solve the case   and neither did anyone else really   it was just routine police work  utterly tedious  br    br   you sat right till the end hoping for a twist   and got nothing but a huge sense of disappointment   br    br   there was so much potential in having a relative in apparent kidnap  could the lt s personal involvement finally cloud his judgement   br    br   all the obvious signs were of a stranger doing it  but surely a genius like lt c  by constant conversation with the wronged husband  would gradually uncover a fiendish plot involving a tape recorder playing in the shower room while a masked groom surprises the bride  hides the body and then plants subtle clues  it could have been good  it was a complete waste of time ',\n  'an uninspired and undistinguished  new  columbo which sees the man in the mac attend his nephew s wedding  only for his bride to disappear on their wedding night  columbo investigates    br    br   and that it is about it  indifferently plotted and surprisingly laden with a flat script  given that it is written by robert van scoyk  who penned the highly enjoyable columbo story  murder under glass  in the detective s heyday  there is not even a murder to speak of and the greatest amount of ingenuity afforded to columbo by the script writer is the narrowing down of suspects via the photos taken at the wedding  which include everybody who was there  br    br   devoid of every columbo trait possible  i thought i was watching an episode of hill street blues  an insult to the history of the series  with appropriately soap opera style acting  very avoidable stuff ',\n  'most definitely the worst columbo ever dreamt up  no murder and the abandonment of the tried and tested formula makes this a real drag  falk looks bored

things to their show instead of the same ole same ole  kids loose interest that way ',\n  'normally when i write a review for a movie online  it is for one of three reasons  either  i have found something exceptionally lacking in a film that otherwise would have been excellent  i feel that the public s perception of a film before viewing it is inaccurate for a number of reasons  or i believe that the purpose or message of a film needs to be clarified or explained with the help of other reviewers  while all of these reasons may appear to be somewhat negative  i find that writing a review that lavishes nothing but praise and statements such as   this is one of the best films of all time    does nothing to enlighten a potential viewer on its merits and downsides  nor does it often give reasoning as to why a movie is so good  which should be the point of the review in the first place  with that being said  war of the worlds is nothing more than a hurried  incompetent attempt at a money grab  piggy backing its loathsome carcass on the multi million dollar advertising campaign of the film of the same name directed by steven spielberg  many people will buy this dvd in anticipation of the summer blockbuster and many more poor souls will buy it looking for more material on the same subject  this movie is not even  so bad  that it becomes funny or endearing  rather the audience will be so unbelievably disappointed as to reach the point of anger  now with most of the insults out of the way  allow me to give some arguments as a warning to those more fortunate than i   br    br   judging from the cover and the lack of any publicity for this film  i found it as sam s club for 8 bucks   i assumed that the cast would be no names and that the special effects would be nothing too spectacular  check  this is not a big deal for me  as i find a large budget and an over reliance on big name stars and se can diminish an otherwise decent movie  i also did not expect to be blown away by great dialog or a moving score  check again  what i did hope for was an actual serious attempt at a classic theme and a few alien battle scenes   br    br   now  as per imdb s policy any spoilers must be announced in advance  no matter how small  so here is fair warning  the movie opens with a lot of inane small talk  followed by a trip to an observatory to look at a red dot  seriously  it is a pictures of a red dot in a tube  it is very hard to describe every little issue in depth  but by the end of the first ten minutes  the combination of shaky camera work  spliced scenes  and a lot of walking begin to frustrate the viewer  however  the costuming is surprisingly not bad and the hope that the pods will reveal something mysterious keeps you going  the next 30 minutes basically go as follows  one of the main characters walks to one of the pods  he looks at the pods and talks to another main character about looking at the pod and it may be hot  they both walk back to town  these walks aren t two seconds or added so that dialog may be exchanged  they are twenty seconds or more and are there simply to add filler to an already bloated three hour movie  in a particularly grueling scene  the main character is shown looking at a pod  then he is shown pacing and panting  then he looks at the pod  then he takes a one minute walk through a field to town  then comes in to town and walks into a building  then he has a cup of coffee and says  thank you mary  to a random maid that serves him coffee  then he puts down the coffee and walks out the building  then he walks a minutes through the field and back to the pod  i apologize for the extreme run on sentence  but it is perhaps the best way to summarize this entire film  characters speak way too long about mundane things  they walk a lot  they send other people to walk  the camera fluctuates between high speed and slow speed  but for no dramatic effect  simply the camera man is a sophomore at tech somewhere  the editing is mind bogglingly bad  people actions make little sense  for instance  when the professor goes to a farmer s house and says that he needs the farmer to give him a ride to town  the farmer stutters and paces around  when the professor says that there is a pod and that men might be trapped inside  the farmer locks him in a shed only to see the professor grab a pitchfork and open the weak shed a second later  nothing of any consequence of course comes from this entire scene  as the professor runs into the main character a moment later so they can begin their afternoon walk  the entire film feels as if someone at one point had a good idea about making a film  but absolutely no idea how to put that in motion  i have seen better high school video productions  finally  the special effects are laughable and do nothing to advance the story  i get the feeling that the director really wanted this film to become somewhat of a cult classic of campy garbage  however  it is so awful in technical aspects  and in sheer common sense that it only makes people mad  avoid this film at all costs ',\n  'i am currently sitting here  forcing myself to finish this  i figure i blew 6 bux on the vhs  might as well suffer for it  i remember about 4 or 5 years ago doing a search on the internet for  war of the worlds  cause of the rumors of the spielberg movie at the time  and i missed the old tv series from the early 90 s  the website make it out that this was a multi million dollar budget rendition of the classic book  it was going to be a  perfect translation   perfect crap is more in tune with this film  br    br   first off  the video on this movie was glitched  it looked as if i was watching the full motion video from an old mid 90 s pc or playstation cd rom video game  sadly enough  the color quality was similar  the acting made shatners classic  dramatic pause  look damn near shakespearean in quality  the cg rendering of various scenes was horrendous  and green screen sequences were worse than those seen in old dukes of hazardd scenes  br    br   secondly  it is slow and terribly drawn out  i sat thru 45 minutes of the video  no promo s at the beginning  before the cylinder actually opened to reveal the first alien  after that  the alien was a terribly constructed cg squid  i am now an hour into it and the most of the alien weaponry i have seen is a spinning silver disk  crappy down even  attached to a mechanical arm  the dramatic scenes are murdered with overly done instrumental s  the last thing on that  for an alien invasion in the turn of the century 1900 s no one is concerned for their life  it s like they have no concept  even though media was slow  word of mouth spreads fast and people would have known  the  illusion  of day and night was shoddy at best  simply changing the color around the people to purple  blue or green does not signify night time  perhaps some lighting and actual night time shoots would have given a much better illusion  there is a lot of wasted sequences throughout the film of just watching the  hero  gallop around or walk down silly roads  get on with the film  i know how people get around  you do not need to be so in depth  br    br   now  finally an hour and 5 minutes into the film and they show the alien machines  mighty morphin power rangers had better looking effects  even the skeletons of vaporized humans looked as if animated by a freshman high school computer app class student  the animations do not match up to the scenery at all  br    br   in closing folks  if you want  the war of the worlds   do one of four things  1  watch the 1953 original  2  watch the early 90 s tv series  3  wait for spielberg s rendition to be released shortly  or 4  read the frikkin book  something we all probably did in elementary english class   avoid this movie  it is a waste of your money ',\n  'i must admit i burst out laughing when i saw one reviewer compare this to lotr  well yes  if you exclude the dwarfs  the cast of thousands  the great special effects  the big battles  the strong characterization  the decent plot  the good acting  the classy direction and everything else  which leaves you with the walking  and boy  does this film do walking  if mr piano had his way  this would probably be an uninterrupted three hours of hardcore walking through the wisconsin countryside  but every 40 minutes or so these pesky martians pop up for a few seconds to interrupt him before he goes for another bit of a ramble  you ve never seen so much walking in a movie  if this really had a  20m budget  most of it must have gone on mr piano s shoes  because he had to get through plenty of pairs with all the walking he does  which explains why there s no money left for decent effects  a decent video camera or proper actors  honestly  it s like watching some bizarre fetish video for people with a thing about going for long walks in period costumes  even on fast forward  this is a looonnnggg walk  br    br   as for the sci fi stuff  i think it was a mistake to put martians in the film  they only get in the way of the walking  which is clearly much more interesting to the director than the story  br    br   i wonder how much mr piano charges to walk dogs ',\n  'wow    br    br   i picked this up at the local wal mart after reading online that it had been released early  i ve been following this online for some time  and just had to buy the film  br    br   wow    br    br   i guess the thing that really struck me was the editing  or lack thereof  time and again  characters  usually the narrator and whoever he is with  are shown walking   and walking   and walking  i am not an editor  but i do know that you can cut between someone leaving point a to show them arriving at point b  there is no need to show almost the entire journey  wow    br    br   i actually ended up feeling somewhat sorry for the actors involved in this  they seem to have been given no direction as to what to do during scenes other than to look scared or look happy  depending on what action was to be added at a later date  br    br   wow    br    br   why it was decided to do almost all the effects using cg is beyond me  even ilm still employs miniatures sometimes  one of the most distracting uses of green screen in this film is the constant rushing about of  according to the end credits  the same group of people representing the citizenry of different towns and cities  including london  at times these folk are coming and going with no regard as to the angle of the shot or the distance they are from the camera  in one shot in london  there appear to be at least two men over six feet tall walking just behind the narrator s brother  played by star anthony piana without his distracting mustache   not since gettysburg have i seen such a fake piece of facial hair  br    br   wow    br    br   why timothy hines talked up this film the way he did is beyond me  it is a turkey  plain and simple  on the plus side  at least for me  it has provided some of the most genuine laugh out loud bits of hilarity i have seen in quite a while ',\n  'is it possible to give a movie no stars  i suppose not  however many stars imdb displays this just think zero and you ll get my drift  director and photographer timothy hines didn t have much of a budget compared to spielberg s herculean effort with the same material  rumored to be the most expensive movie ever made   but that need not be an insurmountable handicap  i ve seen some wonderful work done on a comparative shoestring   soldier and saints  is a recent example   with hard work  integrity and  above all  talent it is certainly possible to realize a faithful rendition of wells  novella    and at fraction of what was spent by dreamworks on its  war of the worlds   unfortunately  hines failed in all these departments  even if he had had spielberg s budget and tom cruise signed for the lead his movie would have stunk just as badly as this barnyard animal he s foisted on us  br    br   primarily  hines seems unable to tell a story  thanks to digital video technology he can record images and sound  but he shows little aptitude for assembling a narrative with what he records  a guy walks down a country lane  a lot  he talks badly aped received english to some other guy  then he walks down the same lane  only shot from the back this time to show he s returning    clever  eh  walking and talking  for nearly an hour that s all that happens  ok  i ll grant that one extended excursion from the main character s house to the impact site on horsell common to show that it s a considerable distance from one place to the other might be useful  a first year film student could storyboard a more economical and more aesthetical establishing sequence than this  btw   but half a dozen times  back and forth  back and forth  et cetera  et cetera with some yakkity yak in between  remarkable  the only explanation for this surfeit of redundancy other than total artistic ineptitude is a desire to pad out thirty minutes of wretchedly amateurish cg works into something that could be offered as a feature length film  finally the martian fighting machines appear and the walking and talking becomes running and talking  or shrieking  later we get staggering and wailing for dessert  br    br   thankfully  much of the dialogue is lifted straight from h g  wells  text  else we d have no idea what is going on  but is it not the whole point of cinema to illuminate a text  to realize what words alone can t convey  if a film relies on dialogue or monologue to tell us what we see or how to feel  why bother  why not do a radio play  orson welles made himself a household name doing just that  however  hines thinks he s a filmmaker  so he s content to mouth the words and swallow the meaning  br    br   secondly  hines was able to buy some cg effects of a sort for his movie  but he has no idea how to use them  now i for one have no unquenchable sweet tooth for eye candy  i believe good science fiction cinema doesn t need dazzling technical effects  some really potent sci fi s have flourished on virtually none at all  but  the war of the worlds  as film requires a certain baseline effort  wells tells a story that hinges on things can be seen and heard and even smelled  the effects don t need to be complex  they can even be crude  e g  fighting machines on wires gliding over miniature streets as seen in the george pal byron haskins 1953 version   but they must be handled well  unfortunately hines  effects are both crude and incompetent \\x96 tripod fighting machines higher than a cathedral spire stomp around making a noise like a pogo stick bouncing on linoleum \\x96 martian squidoids even though oppressed by four times the gravity of their native world scurry and flit about without perceptible effort \\x96 skeletons totally denuded of flesh and muscle writhe and scream    the same damn horse and buggy greenscreens its way across the foreground a dozen times  flipped left for right occasionally in hope that we might not notice  \\x96 and on ad nauseum  crude technique is forgivable  so you have a cg fire effect that s less than convincing  fine  we can work around that  just don t use it too often and only show glimpses of it  that stomped woman sequence looks more like a crushed plum  throw it away  it s not necessary  you say your martian flyer looks like a toy on a string  if you must use it  go ahead  but please don t show it twice  but no  hines won t listen  we get the worst looking stuff used again and again  gotta get those 180 minutes somehow  boy  br    br   next we have acting  or more precisely too much acting  whether in a speaking role or just paid to die on queue everybody in this film is acting his little heart out  evidently hines thinks he s getting a bargain    more fleeing in terror over there  you  quaking behind that tree  let s have a real conniption fit this take  you call that writhing in agony  nonsense  my grandmother can writhe better    nevertheless the cast as a whole and individually stink  they aren t even good amateurs  but this needn t prove fatal  many a good movie has been made with rancid acting  that s what directors are for  and editors  which brings up another point\\x85 who the hell let tim hines edit this cheese factory  if america s butchers were as adept at meat cutting as hines is at film cutting your next hamburger would be all fingers and no beef  in spite of the near three hour running time there is lots of stuff missing from this movie    not sequences  but single frames  creating a herky jerky effect that s nauseating to watch  maybe hines intention was to simulate the effect of a hand cranked cine camera of the 1890 s  if he was i can say he doesn t know how to do it ',\n  'i honestly believe that anyone considering film making be subjected to this mind boggling failure  like the  films  of edward wood  jr  in the  60s and  70s  this film is a shining example of why real filmmakers expend so much energy rewriting scripts  re editing their films  and reworking their special effects until they finally look right  this movie is also a decent argument for the studios  pre screening process  if mr  hines were forced to endure the honest reactions of an impartial audience  perhaps he would have cut 75  or the walking running strolling scenes and edited this movie down to a more bearable 90 minutes  br    br   film students should view this movie as an example of just how dangerous thinking their work is  good enough  can truly be  every performance  every line of dialog  every digital effect  every filter effect  indeed every frame of video expresses the danger of striving for mere mediocrity  a beginning filmmaker may find himself herself tempted from time to time to think  at least i accomplished something  or  just finishing this will be an accomplishment in itself   this movie will help them understand just how badly a film can turn out  br    br   critics might also benefit from seeing this movie before they dub the latest summer entertainment  the worst movie ever made   br    br   beginning writers can learn from this film just how important rewrites are  and perhaps understand the necessity for rewrites  also  beginning directors can learn the importance of a good screenplay  and some degree of respect for just how hard it is to write a script that causes the audience to feel emotionally compelled through the story  writers and directors who watch bad made for cable movies of the week and think  i can do better than that  can see get an idea from this movie how difficult it really is to produce even mediocre results  br    br   i sincerely believe this movie can serve as an educational tool to beginning filmmakers  particularly those entering the craft in this current post lucas and post spielberg environment  there is a reason filmmakers such as these are hailed for their ability with special effects  the war of the worlds illustrates clearly that not everyone can pull it off  some can t even come close to it ',\n  'after hearing the word of mouth of just how bad this film is i took the plunge and bought the dvd  that said everything previously mentioned about this film is true  for a film that claimed to have a budget in the millions it just does not show on the screen at all  the list of problems with the film could drag on forever  chief amongst them is the film is simply too long  it dragged on for a few minutes short of 3 hours  nearly an hour probably could have been cut off the run time had the editor simply removed the overabundance of scenes dealing with nothing more then the main character wandering around aimlessly   br    br   secondly  as many had pointed out from the  trailers   the special effects are anything but special  the tripods looked ok in a few shots here and there but beyond that everything was grade z 1970 s or 1980 s quality  probably the worst effects of all were the horses  which stiffly tottered back and forth as they moved  the heat ray effects were laughable  as people were reduced to bones that somehow were still able to flail about without any muscles  also pitiful was the thunderchild sequence  in which the thunderchild  described in the book as an ironclad ram  looked nothing of the sort  instead it resembled a world war 1 era destroyer  complete with deck guns  which fired but had no visible crew   and torpedo tubes   br    br   the colors and backgrounds were just as bad as the effects  most laughable of all was a scene early on in which the main character and his wife go for a nighttime stroll and he points out mars to her in the sky  well  the sky is black  but the views of the characters and the landscape around them is broad daylight  there is also a very sharp demarcation between the real landscape  bathed in full sunlight  and the fake black night sky with overly large fuzzy stars  to detract even further  the color of the scenes made no sense  in some they are bathed in orange light  in others green light  in still others it s blue light  in some instances the outsides are orange lit but the interiors of houses are green or blue  the frame rate and camera is very shaky  giving everything a stuttering look  br    br   finally  the acting is overall sub par  one man portrays two characters who s sole difference was one lacked a mustache  this led to some confusion at times as to who was who and where they all were  the english accents  even to american ears  are outrageous   br    br   in summary  this movie could very well make a claim to being the worst film released in recent times  i have not seen gigli or some of the other recent flops but this one  because of it s poor quality in every respect  must easily be worse then anything that mainstream hollywood has put out  i would not be surprised if the movie makes it to the bottom 10 or 20 in the imdb rankings  it s a pity that mystery science theater is not still around ',\n  'nu image  ufo and others produce films for the sci fi channel that come in with budgets of roughly  2 million  some feature extensive effects work  others feature recognizable casts and still others feature both    for  2 million  br    br   mr  hines initially claimed that this film was budgeted at  20 million dollars but it s painfully obvious that this was probably produced for  750 000 if not considerably less than that  few sets are utilized  a number of scenes are shot against green screen and most effects seem incomplete and amateurish  br    br   it s painful to watch  not so much because it is poorly directed  poorly executed and misguided but because many of us have been following the progress of this production for quite some time and had high hopes for this film despite its relatively modest budget  br    br   those of us who believed in this movie when it was originally announced have joined the legions of those spoken of by p t  barnum ',\n  'i love movies  and i ll watch any movie all the way through  just to give it a chance  i can finally say that i found a movie i can t watch all the way through  the acting is terribly stale and monotone  the cgi looks like a computer geek did it in his mother s basement with minimal software  and     the long scenes of just   walking     and this movie is three hours long    i didn t even make it 15 minutes until i fast forwarded the dvd  the scenes with the aliens are very short  ummm  instead of naming this  war of the worlds   lets name this  war of the walking long distances   this cost 5 million dollars to make  what they spend the money on  the dramatic opening song  br    br   oh  but on a positive note  one scene you need to watch is when the aliens first begin killing people  that s hilarious  not because people are dying  but because when they turn to skeletons  they still squirm for 20 seconds afterward  br    br   so    like i said  if you are a fan of boring  stale  action less movies  here is one for you dvd collection  but i didn t write this for you  i wrote this for the billions upon billions of other people who will hate this movie  it is not worth your time or money br    br   i know this is by the book  but the book isn t that long  and i m a complete book worm nerd geek whatever  but why  just get the steven spielberg version  it s not all that good  but it s 10 times better than this    br    br   i give this a big  fat zero out of 10 ',\n  'finally i thought someone is going to do justice to h g  wells s classic   not another version set in the wrong locale or era   but one based firmly on the book   well it definitely follows the book pretty closely   and that is the only plus to this mess  br    br   this is 180 min s  yes 3 hours  long   the book is only around 150 pages   br    br   if timothy hines had the nerve to come on here and say  if you can do any better      i would say  yes   i could  and i have never used a video camera or been to any sort or drama school in my life  br    br   i paid good money to get this crap over to the uk from the usa   do not make the same mistake as me  ',\n  'save the  8 97 you ll spend at walmart to buy this dvd and go see the real film by steven spielberg  br    br   i m a filmmaker  and being an avid fan of h g  wells  i had to buy this hoping to sit down and watch three hours of good entertainment  instead  it took four days to finish watching this because i couldn t stand watching more than 10 minutes at a time  it s horrible  br    br   there are reports that timothy hines had a  20 million budget for this production  where the heck did it go  did he use most of it to buy a new house  finance his retirement  or what  let me start with what is actually good about this film  it does stay true to the book and there are a few good performances in it  i can respect the actors who obviously tried to make this a good film  but good performances were quickly overshadowed by horrible    and i do mean horrible special effects  any freshman film school student could have done a much better job with the cgi  to me  most of it looked like  stop action  card board cutouts that were used rather than sophisticated cgi software that a  20 million project should be using  br    br   there s no excuse for the amateur post production that was applied to this film  my own partner and i sat down and recreated our version of the ferry scene using software that cost less than  1500 00 and within a day had five minutes of scene that looked better and more realistic than what hines created  i ve seen films with budgets of less than  2 million look better  much better  br    br   in my opinion the special effects used in the original king kong were more sophisticated and better than hines  special effects in this film  in fact  i have a much better appreciation for attack of the killer tomatoes because of this film  there s no excuse with today s technology for a film to look like a 50 s b movie unless that was the intention  which shouldn t have been with this particular project  br    br   a problem i had with the dvd transfer was that the film is jerky  another demonstration of amateur film making  br    br   overall  i have to say that i produced a  45 000 project in 2003 that have better cinematography and special effects than this film  br    br   i strongly encourage anyone who appreciates good film making or who is a fan of wotw to leave this film on the shelf and watch attack of the 50 foot woman instead  it would be easier on the eyes ',\n  'i m not really sure how to even begin to describe how bad this movie is  i like bad films  as they are often the most entertaining  i love bad special effects  bad acting  bad music  and inept direction  with the exception of the music  which was better than i had expected   this movie had all of those qualities   br    br   the special effects were amazingly bad  the worst i ve seen since my nintendo 64  some scenes to watch for include the thunderchild  the woman being crushed by the mechanical foot  the big ben scene  the train wreck    wow  there are so many bad effects  on the plus side  though  some scenes of the alien walkers are well done  br    br   the acting was about as bad as it could possibly have been  having been based directly on h g  wells  book  for having such good source material  it s almost as though the actors were trying to be so over the top as to make it funny  and then there s the mustache    the single most distracting piece of facial hair i ve seen in a long time  of course  only half the movie contains acting  the rest is characters walking around aimlessly and poorly rendered effects shots  br    br   to say that timothy hines is an inept director would be an injustice to inept directors  with the use of different colored filters between shots for no particular reason  the use of poorly rendered backgrounds for even inside scenes  the bad green screening  it s amazing to me how this man ever got approval to direct a movie  i wouldn t imagine it would be possible to turn a brilliant book into this bad a movie  bravo  mr  hines  bravo   br    br   my advice to anyone who plans to see this movie is to do what i did  have some friends who enjoy bad movies over  drink  play poker while watching it  keep drinking  and maybe you ll make it all the way through  it does make for an excellent bad movie  so have fun and laugh yourself silly with this disaster ',\n  'holy freaking god all freaking mighty  this movie was so bad  i thought i was on drugs  in a bad way    the character acting is the poorest thing i ve seen in quite some time  this movie was more akin to lord of the g strings  imho it s a real movie   most of the movie appeared to be done on a horrible green screen  my favorite part was when they are in the carriage  and you can tell there s no horse  they re fleeing from alien monsters  and going about the same speed as a swift jog  then it switches to a far shot with a ridiculous cg horse  and the cg in general seems to be sub par to 1992 s beyond the mind s eye  i mean  come on  really  it felt like a horrible episode of hercules  only without kevin sorbo there to save the day  worst  movie  ever ',\n  'holy freaking god all freaking mighty  this movie was so bad  i thought i was on drugs  in a bad way    the character acting is the

this dreadful piece of garbage  although i must admit the machines and the martians would have looked really  really cool on an original play station 1 game  and early pc games from the mid 90s if a game had ever been made  what puzzles me is where did the money go  pendragon films could have made a great film with good old fashioned models and computer controlled cameras a la george lucas circa 1975 83  and actors who actually look like they care about what they are doing  or ruining in this case  for about the same 20 million  this is quite possibly the worst film ever made  i would rather sit through a 24 hour repeat screening of ishtar than watch this film again  i hated it completely  i regress  i say this is the worst film ever made because unlike other bad movies like plan 9 or killer tomatoes  or santa claus conquers the martians  these are films that are so bad you have a special place in your heart for them  you love them  there is no love for this film and no place in my dvd library for it  i sold it to a guy for a dollar  i m betting the money for the film was spent on booze and other vices for the cast and crew  shame on you pendragon films  i want my money back ',\n  'i have just lost three hours of my life to this travesty  and i can honestly say i feel violated  i had read the reviews and heard the warnings  and i thought i was prepared for anything   at best i thought  a faithful  if misguided  attempt at an original adaptation  at worst  a so good it s bad  plan 9  for the new millennium  so when i managed to pick up a copy in walmart while in florida and brought it back to the uk  i joked to my friends  prepare for the worst movie ever made   oh  cruel karma  there is absolutely nothing to recommend this film  the  special  effects look like the work of a first year design student using a spectrum zx81  the acting is terrible  the accents are worse than terrible  one artillery mans  accent seems to take us on a tour of the british isles  from scotland to wales via northern ireland   the dialogue is stilted  the editing is non existent  the production values prove that no expense has been gone to  words really cannot describe how bad this movie is  from the union flag flying from the horribly cgi d thunderchild  the royal navy flies the white ensign  not the union flag  to the woodworm ridden acting  this is quite simply a crime against film making  when you consider some of the literally zero budget fan films that are available on the  net  the star wars short  troops  for example   the whole  we re enthusiastic amateurs  argument goes right out of the window  and if you believe an interview with hines on the pendragon website  this film had an 8 figure budget  i can only assume that dodgy facial hair does not come cheap in the us  maybe the problem is that hines   co tried to make a film of the book  rather than turn the book into a film  if that makes any sense   characters and extras spout chunks of text verbatim without trying to convey the feelings behind the words  ironically enough  the only person who even came close to giving a decent performance was darlene sellers  the ex soft porn actress  my advice  pray like crazy that jeff wayne doesn t screw up  and go watch the spielberg version  it may not be true to the text of the book  but i can say this  as a lifelong hg wells fan  and englishman as well  speilbergs film is true to the spirit of the book  maybe customs were wrong to let me carry this monster into the country  but i will say this  timothy hines stole three hours of my life  and i want them back ',\n  'well  on it s credit side  if it can be said to have one   timothy hines did manage to capture the original setting of h g  wells  outstanding novella  but other than that   well  to call a spade a spade   it sucks bigtime  what the master ed wood could have done with the alleged  20 million dollar budget  timothy hines really does make mr  wood  who was a flawed genius anyway  look like the best filmmaker of all time  the special effects  i guess you d call them that  are not even up to computer game standards  the acting is  well  perhaps about dinner theater comparable  and the accents are atrocious  at the risk of sounding offensive  a lot of the acting from the principal male characters is  especially poor ogilvy   well  ahem        gay  poor ogilvy minces and flounces about the bogus english countryside  waving his asbestos white handkerchief about as if it were heat resistant armor  hey  the stormtroopers in  star wars  had neat white body armor too  and it didn t work either  they still got blasted  even when ogilvy and company get fried by the martians   heat ray      they flounce and mince in some weird kind of dance  even when they re theoretically dead and reduced to skeletons  which persist in unseemly dancing and writhing  maybe timothy hines rented the skeletons from ray harryhausen  being left over from  jason and the argonauts   or was it  josie and the pussycats   i dunno  the soldiers  presumably because they re  military   all seem to just rather unconvincingly explode  like the soldier on crutches and his unfortunate comrades carrying the stretcher just beyond him  wow  i loved it  but the  soldiers  all looked like they were either fascist troops from the spanish civil war  or boer commandos  which would be more or less correct for the period  perhaps that was some bit of shrewd subtlety on the part of that wicked genius hines    oddly enough  the character of the curate looks exactly like he s drawn in the original illustrations by warwick goble  and he also turns in the most convincing job of acting  oh  yeah  musn t forget the thunder child  in the book  the warship is described as an ironclad torpedo ram  it was meant to ram enemy ships  yet  it s bow was crumpled after ramming the tinker toy constructed martian war machines  with a tiny jagged hole in the forepeak  and she sank  an ironclad warship like thunderchild could ve rammed the titanic and survived  but i guess the royal navy was bound by the same lowest bidder constraints as our own military  the costumes are all wrong  especially the british army and police uniforms  cobbled together mostly from usmc alphas  and timbo  in an obvious homage to western films of yore  has obviously set his movie in wild western england  because all his riders are using western saddles  the accents being used by just about everyone appear to be a mixture of some kind of scottish regional accent used by clan macabre  and magically delicious irish accents from county malarky  on the credit side  and contrary to what one reviewer wrote  the only genuine  authentic feature of this thing is the artillery  the guns are not from the civil war  but appear to my eye and research as bona fide british nine or 12 pounder rifled breach loaders  perfectly authentic to the period  so was the ammunition shown being used  but the artilleryman  who is a driver in the horse artillery  was not shown correctly driving his limber  you don t sit on the frigging limber box and drive a gun team  you ride the nearside wheel horses  the opening  using what i believe is authentic period film footage  is okay  and the score s not bad  however  to the best of my knowledge weybridge has never had an underground  and it certainly didn t in 1898  br    br   but growing up reading this novel  i am very disappointed  even more disappointed then i was at spielberg s zillion dollar  special effects laden version  maybe his version would have profited by swapping anthony piana for tom cruise  and vice versa  i have a lot more to say  but i ll let it go at this for now  i wish somebody would make a good version of  war of the worlds  that s faithful to the original  timmy s vision is fine for a high school film class  or maybe i should say pretentiously stupid for a college level film student  and about as bad  which is about the best i can say for this thing  but that s about it  oh  yeah  just where did the budget go  and what happened to michael caine  i d like to hear his comments  i have a sneaking suspicion that timbo  orson wood  hines  breathtaking  bound breaking cinema masterpiece just might be the risk taking director s ticket to cult stardom  because  i must confess a guilty pleasure at watching this movie  which i didn t pay for anyway but was thoughtfully sent to me by a friend who burned a dvd copy for me  with no malicious intent that i ve been able to determine  i must add here that i thought blackmoon s dubbed and abridged version was not only a vast improvement  but an absolute  hysterically funny  in a good way  treat to watch  i find it hard to watch master timbo s version after blackmoon  keep it up  tim  make your own version of  dune   now  it just awaits the hand of a master like you  and all you headupyourass snobs who hated cloverfield  forget it  it cannot beat timbo hines artistry for sheer hilarious awfulness  hey get a life timbo is worse than the master ed wood  i kid you not ',\n  'hines and goforth  the perpetrators of this crime  begin on the wrong foot first step  by assuming that wells wrote gothic horror and that all of his lines are meant to be taken seriously  that simply isn t true  wells was very much an inheritor of the enlightenment  and his main concern was that victorian self satisfaction might leave the british unprepared for the world the new technology could produce   both the good and the bad  br    br   two terrible consequences follow   the protagonist is portrayed as a wimpy screamer  i was reminded of fay wray in the original king kong   rather than a man struggling to live out the ironies of an unbelievable catastrophe  and the dialog reeks of  victorianisms  uttered seriously that welles clearly meant to be taken tongue in cheek  br    br   all of this looks suspiciously like ed wood with an enormous budget to waste on cgi effects   which by the way are so poorly accomplished  the warner bros  cartoon factory of the 1940s could have done a better job   gobs of spattered blood looked like red balloons  i expected them to float away any minute   think the yellow submarine as done by the old ec comics  br    br   worse yet is the loss of theme  which robs the film of any reason to exist  although the makers of this film return the story to its victorian era  they utterly miss the uncanny way wells  story predicted many of the horrors of the first world war   a fact not unnoticed by wells himself  who  after the war  reworked the theme in the shape of things to come  br    br   without any theme  all we have here are a lot of people running around getting blasted into cartoon balloons  when they re not

apartment  so i didn t need this put down of wells for anything  br    br   do not avoid this film   steal every copy you can  don t pay a cent  and burn each and every one of them  god in his wisdom

pointless slash movie that uses the interesting concept of eliminating the greatest innermost fear of each friend before it grows  but in a messy screenplay full of clichés  there are some exaggerated

a similar plot  but it is impossible to connect to the original  with the exception of the presence of morty  the mannequin monster made of wood  here is a brief overview  br    br   twenty years after mike hawthorne  gordon currie  in a decent performance  witnesses his father brutally murder his mother and then take his own life  mike is still suffering from the fear of that day  in hopes of ridding his fear  mike takes his girlfriend and a bunch of friends up to his grandparents  home  his plan is for everyone to dress up in costumes that represent their fears  and then present the fears to the mannequin morty  according to an indian friend  this process is supposed to magically take away one s fear  what mike doesn t know is that morty is possessed with his father s spirit  and begins killing off the friends   or is it really mike himself doing the killings  who cares  br    br   a have a few troubles with this film  the first lies with morty  i thought the original made morty look rather convincing  this time  it is painfully obvious morty is a man  actor jon fedele  in a fake looking suit  this can especially be seen in early scenes  where morty is still supposed to be inanimate  but if you watch closely you can see him blinking  another trouble is that most of the characters don t try hard enough  some of them do  namely betsy palmer  of friday the 13th fame  who was excellent in this film  but most of them don t make the effort or weren t given the chance  finally  there are the killings  the opening scenes involving ax murders were very convincing  actually  when i saw them i thought i was in for a good movie  when the second half of the movie arrives  and the killings really start  everything falls to pieces  deaths are either uncreative  unseen  or foreseen  glimpses of the next scene as currie has a blackout   one character dies in the end and no one  including the viewer  even notices  while more characterization was needed in the beginning half  it wasn t too bad  the second half was  i think new director chris angel got to this point and really didn t know how to shoot the violent scenes  so they turned out real sloppy and pedestrian  a silly ending doesn t help either  thus  unless you really loved the original and enjoy plucking splinters out from under your skin  you should probably skip  the fear 2  halloween night

grandson of scoobidoo writers  and what about the sfx and colors  they are so extreme that it is painful to watch  colors are not saturated they are over saturated  like scripts are overwritten and show is overrated  this show is like a bad pie in which a child would have put only sugar and butter thinking that because these ingredients are the best  they are sufficient  unfortunately for this show  the only two ingredients of this show are finally vacuity and a total lack of credibility ',\n  'i am very disappointed with this movie because i like these french actors and i liked  buffet froid  from this director  bertrand blier  but the script of  les acteurs  is very poor  why these actors they agreed to play this poor scenario ',\n  'i am really shocked that a great director like chuck jones started out making some of the most incredibly boring cartoons i ve ever seen  i did not laugh once throughout this short  and it s a bugs bunny cartoon  for christ s sake  bugs bunny

dull cartoon is always no gag payoff  good night elmer was boring because it dragged on the same two gags forever with predictable payoff  this cartoon  on the other hand  is afflicted with the second warning sign of a dull cartoon  there s too much dialogue  the cartoon at least has more than two gags up its sleeve  but most of them seem longer than they are thanks to the immense padding of the dialogue  at one point  elmer finishes eating dinner  and comments   that was weawwy awfuwwy good weg of wamb   possibly the most redundant dialogue i ve ever heard in a cartoon  characters reading text out loud in the later era woody woodpecker cartoons doesn t count in my book   even though this cartoon is only 8 minutes long  it feels like 20 thanks to redundant dialogue like this  br    br   elmer s pet rabbit was not a fun cartoon for me  but if you ve sold your soul to chuck jones and are unable to acknowledge that he directed a few clunkers during his career  you might enjoy it ',\n  'i am amazed at the amount of praise that is heaped on this movie by other commentators  to me it was rather a disappointment  especially the combination of historical facts  fantasy and the main character s internal turmoil does not work at all  in vonnegut s book slaughterhouse five and even in george roy hill s adaptation for the screen it does   credibility is often overstretched  too many questions are left open  did i miss some central points  or did i fail to spot the lines that supposedly connect the dots   br    br   a boy called campbell  jr   grows up in upstate new york  at home his father has many technical trade papers and one book  it has photographs of heaps of dead bodies in it  the boy leafs through the book  his dad doesn t like his doing that  what should this tell me  the family moves away from upstate new york to berlin  bang  it is 1938  the boy is a married man in berlin and a theater playwright  what kind of plays does he write  in what language  is he successful  his wife is an actress and looks glamorous  the parents move back to the usa and invite their son to do the same  he does not  why  because having grown up in germany he feels more german than american  because he is successful  because his wife is  because he likes his life there  because he likes the nazis  because he is just plain lazy and doesn t like change  don t ask me  br    br   possibly  the man just does not care  is not interested in politics  is a kind of an existentialist  he states that he is deeply in love with his wife  he speaks of his republic of two  meaning he and his wife   there is little to no evidence proving his love for his wife in the movie  it much more seems a republic of one  br    br   on the request of an american agent campbell  jr   agrees to broadcast anti semitic nazi hate propaganda to american listeners as a device for transmitting encrypted messages to american authorities who read between the lines  the crucial meeting with the agent on a berlin park bench is short  unexciting and anti climactic  the decision to play along comes pretty easily with no explanation  the rise up to broadcaster seems to be uneventful and apparently fast  br    br   so now we have campbell  jr   presenting himself over the air as the last free american  the scheme for transmitting secret messages is fairly realistic and exciting   although one wonders what happened when campbell  jr   really and honestly had to cough  hiccup etc   must have scrambled the messages terribly   anyway  the nazis lose  the wife dies  touring in the crimean for german troops   i never heard such tours really happened on german front lines in ww ii   campbell  jr   says he goes to the russian front but does not go  is captured by an american soldier who recognizes his mug  how come    is dragged to a sight seeing tour in auschwitz  is then released and resettled with the help of the crucial agent somewhere in the city of new york  br    br   and this is where the story really starts  br    br   bang  from now on it is like a short story by paul auster  it is 1961  campbell  jr   lives in new york tenement as a has been and mourns the loss of his wife  nobody really cares   or do they  yes  somehow they do  and his neighbors offer some sort of distraction  auschwitz survivors  a painter  some american supremacists \\x84discover  him and want him to be their figurehead  they even find his presumed dead wife for him  or is she his wife  anyway  in the end campbell  jr   calls in at the israeli consulate  and they obligingly give him the big war criminal treatment  placing him in the cell adjacent to adolf eichmann s  he writes his life story and  once this task finished  hangs himself on the typewriter s ribbons without getting sooty the least bit  br    br   while i can see that there must be an issue of guilt and of loss  i just had the impression that the main character is a person who at all times is pretty indifferent to everything and hardly capable of love for anyone  so i found it difficult to sympathize for this looser who mourns his loss  amazingly  many reviewers focus on his status as a potential war hero  having put his reputation at stake for playing the last free american  i assume according to them this took a lot of courage  as a matter of fact  however  the movie suggests that by accepting the assignment campbell created for himself a win win situation  as he would have been politically on the safe side no matter who had won the war  the danger of his being uncovered never comes up during the first part of the story  br    br   one might argue  that the whole story is a dreamlike fantasy and that nobody should bother with historical accuracy or a logical development of the story which explains everything  but even then it fails to make a point  primarily  i suspect  because the love affair in the republic of two falls completely flat  this is a pity  especially if you consider that the wife was played by sheryl lee  a talented  versatile and sensuous actress  she has much too little screen time and is forced to use a ridiculous german accent  another somehow neglected aspect are the different texts  confession  broadcast and hidden messages   but i guess this is largely unfilmable  maybe i should give the book a chance ',\n  'this was an awful movie  not for the subject matter  but for the delivery  i went with my girlfriend at the time  when the movie came out   expecting to see a movie about the triumph of the human spirit over oppression  what we saw was 2 hours of brutal police oppression  with no uplift at the end  the previews and ads made no mention of this  plus  for all that they played up whoopi goldberg  my recollection is that she is arrested and killed in the first 20 minutes  again  the previews say nothing about this   not that you would expect that  but it s just more of the problem   if i had known how depressing this movie would be  i would ve never have seen it  or at least  i would ve been prepared for it  this was a bait and switch ad campaign  and i will never see this movie again ',\n  'the concept for sarafina appears to be a sound one  that is aside from the musical perspective  it attempts to combine upbeat african music with a story describing the atrocious conditions and atmosphere that black people were forced to endure at the time the film was set  the contradictions of each of the two elements are too glaring and the film never justifies such rapid shifts between jubilation and terror  had it simply been a drama reflecting these conditions it may have been a good film  however the scenes of school children being shot down by soldiers don t exactly sit well next to the songs   br    br   aside from the poor premise the acting isn t the best either  goldberg gives a mediocre performance as does the remainder of the cast  overall a disappointment  br    br   3 10',\n  'i just didn t get this movie

terminator woman  pretty well  karen sheperd and another woman are trying to escape from the villain s camp  karen runs across an armed guard  who points his gun at her  but after a few seconds throws it away and challenges her to a fight  karen kicks him in the balls  picks up the gun and runs away  then again  when a film is directed by a martial artist and written   produced by another member of his family  you know you shouldn t expect too much  karen sheperd and jerry trimble do get some amusing banter going early on  and the film might have turned out better if it had focused more on their love hate relationship  but after about 20 minutes they get separated  and the film slows to a crawl  and even with the occasional fight scene to liven things up  it lacks excitement  the finale has trimble fighting qissi inside a cave and sheperd going womano a womano against the beautiful ashley hayden on a speedboat  but the fights are intercut in a way that breaks their flow and diminishes their value  on the positive side  kudos to the costuming department for giving karen the chance to show spectacular cleavage throughout the film    1 2 ',\n  'this film has got several key flaws  the first and most significant of which is the clear lack of a good plot  this sadly makes the film not only difficult to watch but also sends the watcher certain feelings of hopelessness  as if he or she is wasting valuable time of their short life  this means that the film cannot captivate it s audience  instead it encourages the viewing public to grow contempt for the film and everything associated with it  in short  it really is very very very very very very very bad  do yourself a favour and chew on a large rubber shoe  you ll find it far more interesting and enjoyable than watching terminator woman ',\n  'you may want to know up front that i am not a mormon  unlike a good number of those who have already reviewed this film  i mention this so you ll understand that the way i look at the film may differ greatly from those in the faith  for some  being critical of the film might be seen as being critical of the faith  and that is not my intention  so  my review is that of an outsider trying to look inside and learn more about who this man and his people were  well  after seeing the film  i doubt if i have learned much at all  since i have been a history teacher  i have a good basic understanding about young as well as joseph smith as well as the teachings of the church  but anyone wanting to see this film to really learn anything will probably be disappointed because the film seems so gosh darn nice  too nice and too unrealistic in its portrayal  plus  you learn practically nothing about the church s beliefs other than they are nice people  work hard and some have many wives  and this latter part is only barely hinted at in the film   instead  the people are almost cartoon like in their simplistic portrayals  joseph smith and brigham young and their followers are angelic  the non mormons were all devils and brian donlevy  playing exactly the same sort of role edward g  robinson later played in the ten commandments  is the trouble maker who claims to be a mormon but just comes along so the film can have a bad guy  it s all so very simple    too simple  almost like an indoctrination film or infomercial  br    br   brigham young especially was a very complex man  with many good points  an excellent organizer and visionary  as well as bad  don t even get me started on his views about blacks within the church or intermarriage   to portray him in such vague terms is just plain silly  it s also a lot like how gandhi was portrayed in the film with ben kingsley  only the facts that led to his being almost super human were emphasized  heck  now that i think about that  this is the trouble with most religious films  they often come off as one dimensional  trite and bland  let s have a full and more complete film of these men  one that will stick to facts and not emotional appeals  br    br   now if you can ignore the fact that you won t learn very much about the faith or its second leader  the film is enjoyable enough  it s obvious someone at 20th century fox really cared about the film  as they had a wonderful cast of both premier actors  tyrone power   up and coming actors  linda darnell  jane darwell and vincent price  and wonderful character actors  dean jagger  john carradine and brian donlevy   the film also had wonderful location shooting and lots of gloss  it just didn t have a lot to tell us other than they were all  swell   plus  there were plenty of factual errors and a few just plain dumb scenes  a few of the mistakes include young taking over the helm immediately after the death of joseph smith  it was three years later   no mention of the various mormon denominations and splinter groups  talk of  gold in california   even though it was 1847 and gold wouldn t be discovered until 1948  as well as no specific mention of polygamy or smith s many wives  just plain dumb scenes include carradine pulling out a gun and waving it about in the courtroom scene  and no one seemed to care  even though it was a very hostile audience  don t you think at least the judge would tell him to put it away and stop threatening people with it   br    br   one final comment  do not  i repeat  do not watch this film when it s shown on american movie classics  a one great station that has sunk a lot in recent years   while i am critical of the film because of its simplistic message  i was horrified with the complete disrespect the station had for the church and its traditions  what i mean is this  the film was punctuated with ads for penis enlargement formulas as well as tons of pop ups  some advertising a show that features the  sexiest cast    talk about disrespectful and gross and i would be just as offended if they did this for any other religious film  by doing this  they not only insult the faith but marginalize their market  after all  who is into hearing about these things and the life of brigham young   is this a movie  in this form  that you can show to your kids or recommend to others  ',\n  'this film  though ostensibly a comedy  is deadly serious  its subject is imperialism  with a capital i   how britain  foolishly  humiliatingly  tries to convince itself that it s still a great power after world war ii  at home  the empire is run by amiable dolts  benevolent tories who are so in bred that they can t distinguish close relatives  the offices of government consist of long forgotten archives  a dig at orwellian paranoia    inhabited by indolent rats  and ante rooms wherein lounge bored synacures  reading popular novels  br    br   abroad  britain clings to the old pomp  but pomp out of context looks threadbare and silly  especially when its embodied in bumbling twits  carlton browne is an unsentimental picture of decline  with none of the lachrymose rot that marred the supposedly anti imperialist jewel in the crown  br    br   the film is also about the cold war  bravely admitting that it s a dangerous farce  whose participants deserve mockery and contempt  not fear and respect  it s about how colonialism  characterised more by neglect than tyranny  destroys the colonies it deserts  robbing them of amenities  power  and  most importantly  self respect  leaving them vulnerable to the machinations of dangerous cowboys  br    br   it s the seriousness  of course  that kills it  that s not to say that weighty subjects can t be treated in comedy   the miracle of morgan s creek  dr  strangelove and the life of brian have all proved that  indeed  one might suggest that serious themes should only be treated by comedy   it allows for a clearer eyed view  br    br   the problem with carlton browne is that every situation must have a significance beyond the merely comic  so that it becomes weighed down and unfunny  in the three films mentioned above  much of the comedy arises from character reaction to an extreme situation  not the extreme situation itself  here  the script is too poor to sustain rich comic characterisations  and some of the greatest comedy talent ever assembled   peter sellers  terry thomas  raymond huntley and john le mesurier   are criminally wasted  br    br   terry thomas  sublime so often  shows that he couldn t handle lead parts  and that he needed to play sneering  arrogant bounders  not brainless toffs  the music is made to carry much of the comedy  but its heavy irony only draws attention to the lack of hilarity on screen   to be fair  unlike the majority of british comedies of the period  which were stagy and underproduced  the boultings often try to make their points through film itself  by montage and composition  only huntley manages to raise genuine laughs  and that s by essaying a character he could have played in his sleep  br    br   none of the boultings  farces have dated well   they re never thought through enough  although carlton browne revels in the decline of the empire  it also seems to be anti democratic and militaristic  i m sure this wasn t intended  but these blunders are bound to happen if you allow worthy intentions to take precedence over comic intelligence and film form ',\n  'the main reason people still care about  carlton browne of the f o   is that it features peter sellers in a second billed role  but watching this film to see peter sellers is a mistake  br    br   sellers plays amphibulos  a vaguely reptilian prime minister of the dirt poor island nation of gaillardia  formerly a british colony  now hosting a lot of russian diggers during the height of the cold war  amphibulos wants to play both u k  and soviet interests against each other for easy profit   everything very friendly and all our cards under the table   terry thomas is the title character  a lazy british diplomat anxious to show gaillardia that great britain hasn t forgotten them  all appearances to the contrary  br    br   a positive review here says   the reason this movie is considered average is because the comedy is understated   i would argue that the reason  carlton browne  is considered below average is because the comedy is non existent  br    br   after a decent opening that establishes the film s only two strengths  a sympathetically doltish terry thomas and john addison s full on larky score  things quickly slow down into a series of slow burns and lame miscommunication jokes  the low opinion of carlton browne by his boss and the obscurity of gaillardia  which no one can find on a map  is milked to death  by the time we actually reach the island  after a labored series of airsick jokes   expectations are quite low  br    br   they re still too high  though  the island itself  which seems to exist either in latin america or the mediterranean  is so pathetic its honor guard faints at the airport  and the review stand falls apart in the middle of a parade  the army is apparently still horse drawn  allowing for another lame aural gag by a thick accented announcer   in war  the army uses many horse   br    br   sellers never quite takes center stage even when we re on his character s island  the plot is taken over instead by ian bannen as king loris  who inherits the throne of gaillardia after his father s assassination  bannen is dull and plays his part as straight as it is written  normally this would make him the likely target for scene stealing by sellers  but trapped behind a thick accent and greasy moustache  sellers is only a threat to those of us who remember him far more happily in two other films made this same year   the mouse that roared  and  i m all right  jack   br    br   strange that this film  like  jack   was a boulting brothers production  with roy boulting here serving as co director alongside jeffrey dell  usually boulting films combine wicked social satire with anything goes comedy  but here there are only fey jabs in either direction  amphibulos works his mangled english vibe for all its worth   this man is like  how do you say  the bull in the chinese ship   while carlton browne is generally ragged on by his superior far more than he seems to deserve  br    br   the weakest and most protracted element of the film is young loris s romance with ilyena  score one point for her being played by ravishing luciana paluzzi  dock one for the fact that they are apparently cousins is never addressed  br    br   the film winds up with a lamely staged revolution whose surprise resolution will surprise no one  and a final bit of action by carlton browne that would seem to nail the lid on his coffin literally  apparently he lives to see another day  but the film of the same name is strictly doa ',\n  'it was meant to be a parody on the lotr trilogy  but this was one of the most awful movies i ve ever seen  bad acting  bad screenplay  bad everything  this is my personal opinion  i don t doubt any second that there are people who ll like this sense of  humor   but there have been better parodies on movies from acclaimed directors as mel brooks or the zucker brothers  i m working in a movie theater and in dvd shop and the success for this movie was similar in both areas  at the movies it was a nice  but no big at all  success during the first two weeks but then  when the reviews of those who have seen it were not too good  the movie dropped very fast  in dvd sales it was good for short time but then nobody asked for it anymore  in the last ten years  the two worst movies i ve seen are the ring thing and torque  i can t decide which one was worse  but i m happy that there a so many good movies so i don t have to think too much on this question ',\n  'this movie is one of the worst movies i have ever seen  there is absolutely no storyline  the gags are only for retards and there is absolutely nothing else that would make this movie worth watching  in the whole movie fredi  oh my god what a funny name  ha ha  doesn t ask himself once how he came from a plane to middle earth  there are plenty of stupid and totally unfunny characters whose names should sound funny  e g    gandalf is called almghandi  sam is called pupsi     and so on  i didn t even smile once during the whole movie  the gags seem like they were made by people whose iq is negative  if you laugh when someone s coat is trapped in the door  this happens about 5 times  then this movie is perhaps for you  another funny scene  they try to guess the code word for a closed door  don t ask why  don t ever ask  why  in this movie  and the code word is  ha ha   dung  so if you laughed at this examples you might like this movie  for everybody else  go to youtube and watch  lord of the weed   it s a lot  lot more fun ',\n  'this sounded like a really interesting movie from the blurb  nazis  occult   government conspiracies  i was expecting a low budget nazi version of the davinci code or the boys from brazil or even shockwaves  instead you get something quite different  more psychological  more something like from david lynch  that was actually a plus  but the way the story is told is just awful  br    br   part of the trouble is the casting  andrienne barbeau s character starts off the moving being somewhat timid and afraid  she just doesn t do that well  even at her age  though she certainly tried  the actor cast as the son apparently thought this was a comedy  most of the other actors also seemed to have thought this was a campy movie  or at least acted like it  rather than simply being quirky  the only one that i thought did really well was the daughter  siri baruc  br    br   another big part is the pacing  it starts off very slowly  so slowly you might be tempted to turn it off  but then it gets compelling for a while when you get to the daughter s suicide and the aftermath  but shortly afterward  it all becomes a jumbled mess  some of this was on purpose  but much of it was just needlessly confusing  monotonous  and poorly focused  br    br   the real problem  is it s simply not a pleasant movie to watch  it s slow  dull  none of the characters are likable  overuse of imagery and sets  some movies you see characters get tortured  in this  it s the viewer that does  it does have a few creepy moments  most notably the creepy nazi paintings and the credits  but the rest of the movie is mostly just tiresome ',\n  'this is a movie of tired  yet weirdly childish  clichés  there s a nazi witch master performing sf related experiments in the basement  oh please   br    br   aiming for a creeping sense of horror and fear  the general impression of the film is that of a very immature conception of fright  not having any expectations beforehand  i am left with  an aged xander from buffy and a heroine with ape like face who doesn t seem to know how to act  said adrienne barbeau have i only only encountered before in the much more enjoyable  cannibal women in the avocado jungle of death   br    br   camera and editing adds to the general impression of lame ',\n  'can i please say first of all  that i felt so strongly about this movie that i signed up to imdb specifically to review it  and my review  this is easily the worst movie i have ever seen  br    br   the synopsis of the movie sounded interesting  nazis  occult  time travel  etc   but the movies plot failed to properly bring all these elements together  remember the episode of south park that featured manatees writing family guy using  idea balls   did these manatees also write unholy  its like the writer wanted to include all these different ideas  but had no idea how to link them all together  and then to make things make even less sense  included a donnie darko esquire time travel theme to the ending  messing up the chronology  br    br   i could tell from early on that this was a bad movie  special effects were too low budget for anything better than straight to dvd  the acting wasn t great  but in fairness i ve seen worse  i will praise the nazi paintings  they were creepy  but the evil nazi butcher guy was just comic  br    br   i don t have a vendetta against this movie or anything  but to be honest  i m not even into the horror genre  but this movie cannot be described as a thriller or a drama  if this story had been well told  this would have been a good movie  but it has been over hyped  waaaaay over hyped ',\n  'when i started watching this movie i saw the dude from buffy  xander  and figured ah how nice that he s still making a living acting in movies  now a weird movie i can stand  given that it s a good dose of weird like for example david lynch movies  twin peaks  lost highway etc  and you sort of have to be in the mood for one  this one however made me mockingly remember the crazy websites about there about conspiracy theory s that make absolutely no sense  i mean come on people nazi s who conspire with america to make an unholy trinity of evil powers  i was surprised they didn t mention the hollow earth in this movie with hitler flying saucers and lizard people  maybe if you had like 60 grams of heroine with this movie it would make some sort of sense  but seriously i don t condone drugs like i don t condone this movie  it should be burned  shredded and forgotten just so good ol  xander might get another acting job  it wasn t his acting though  that was alright  but the script just didn t make any sense  sorry ',\n  'i m not sure this is a spoiler  perhaps it is a public service  if you are one of those people focused on instant gratification who skip end credits  you will miss the final line of the end credits news announcer s voice over  which states the u s  has just surrendered to nazi germany on may 7  1945 to end wwii  here are just a few of the problems with this close   br    br   1 the older viewer must conjure up the equivalent of two or three more unholy movies in their mind s eye to fill in the yawning chasm between movie events and this startling conclusion  br    br   2 the average person will really kick themselves that they did not  watch  one of these unholy fill in the blanks flicks created in their own head for free  instead of shelling out time and money to see this unholy from the video store  or on cable   br    br   3 this end credits sequence of imagined news bulletins may be the first information some younger viewers are exposed to about wwii  leading them to the conclusion that george w  bush is the latest heir to the nazi throne ',\n  'i read rice s novel with interest  and became quite enchanted with its characters and heartbreaking tale based on historical truths  br    br   however  i was simply appalled at this disastrous adaptation  the casting was based merely on physical appearance  and not acting talent  with the obvious exception of peter gallagher  who was neither blond haired  or able to act his way out of a wet paper bag   the cast s embarrassingly clumsy and inconsistent attempts at affecting a french accent was hilarious  but not in an entertaining way  i found myself wincing through this muddled and melodramatic tripe  and was surprised i made it to the end  br    br   a warning to fans of the novel   stay away from this one ',\n  'this movie was so badly written  directed and acted that it beggars belief  it should be remade with a better script  director and casting service  the worst problem is the acting  you have jennifer beals on the one hand who is polished  professional and totally believable  and on the other hand  ri chard  who is woefully miscast and just jarring in this particular piece  peter gallagher and jenny levine are just awful as the slave owning  and keeping  couple  although both normally do fine work  the actors  and director  should not have attempted to do accents at all  they are inconsistent and unbelievable  much better to have concentrated on doing a good job in actual english  the casting is ludicrous  why have children of an  african  merchant  thus less socially desirable to the gens de couleur society   been cast with very pale skinned actors  while the supposedly socially desirable marcel  has pronounced african features  including an obviously dyed blond  fro   it s as if the casting directors cannot be bothered to read the script they are casting and to chose appropriate actors from a large pool of extremely talented and physically diverse actors of color  it s just so weird  this could be a great movie and should be re made  but with people who respect the material and can choose appropriate and skilled actors  there are plenty of good actors out there  and it would be fun to see how jennifer beals  daniel sunjata and gloria reuben would do with an appropriate cast  good script and decent direction ',\n  'the story and the show were good  but it was really depressing and i hate depressing movies  ri chard is great  he really put on a top notch performance  and the girl who played his sister was really awesome and gorgeous  seriously  i thought she was

glad i saw the movie before reading the book  this is a little too real  for me  i prefer lestat and louis s witty little tiffs to the struggles of slaves  eartha kitt was so creepy and after her

carelessly applied it looks like someone used a ketchup dispenser and just squirted straight lines of red on the costumes  br    br   this whole battle scene comes off as the spoof of a really cheesy

ridiculous bit of writing  directing and casting is actually the focus of the scene   br    br   a little girl is standing under the dead body of her hanging father  who is terribly mutilated  and literally dripping blood form his gaping wounds  even a totally idiot would know he is dead  yet she is  very monotonously  repeating over and over  daddy  daddy     while looking at someone off screen  she delivered it with about as much believability and passion as you could expect from an non actor kid that had been repeating the line for the cameras all day  br    br   even if the poor kid had any acting skills  the scene is completely unbelievable  the little girl wouldn t even be in the middle of the battlefield after hours of carnage  surrounded by hundreds of dead bodies  while she calmly stands there   natural instincts would had the kid screaming and terrified  running away from the bloody carnage   br    br   are we suppose to be horrified or laugh      br    br   one particularly goofy detail  that gives the scene an snl satire tone  is the father hanging  with a huge hook through his mouth and cheek  he looks like a fish on a hook  the unintentionally funny

character  the little girl s mother  at the end of the scene and in the next scene  that occurs 20  years later  she looks exactly the same  she is still young and beautiful  and now the same age as her daughter   br    br   i almost turned the movie off right there because the direction and writing were obviously awful  but i tried to stick it out because i wanted to see the louisiana settings

are short a few people  then  a killer is on the loose  i honestly wanted to say i was going to enjoy this one  it had a fair set up  or maybe that was just daphne zuniga in it  the film is too slow  and almost as silent as a library  most of the acting is below average  and the  point of view  moments are so old news  acclaimed composer christopher young of such films as  hellraiser  and  entrapment  scored this  in a repetitive cue line that was better made for a tv movie  still  it seems higher than the movie deserves  so  other than young and zuniga  this one scrapes the bottom of

all the things a horror fan dreams of  so  after hearing all of that info  i settled into pranks  alt  title  expecting a sleazy slasher experience      and that s what it tried to be  but failed pretty much completely  visually  the film s not great  the cinematography  gore  except for a couple scenes   and overall direction all fail  it s simply not enjoyable to watch  the unoriginal script is lacking and often throws in random things without any real reason  like the opening kill   there are some cool death scenes  including a pretty nice face melt  which can be seen on the poster   but that s about it for the positive  the acting is pretty bad  the story seems unimportant  the killer isn t cool or scary  and it suffers the one major error that any slasher flick should always avoid  it s a bit boring  overall  for a film done by a few ucla film students for  90 000  which would be over double that today   the dorm that dripped blood isn t a total mess  it has a couple good things  and is fairly watchable      but  as a slasher flick looking to be on the level of films like the house on sorority row and pieces      it just cannot compare  don t expect much  and you may at least be entertained  i hate to say it  but this is one of the few films i ve seen that would actually be better with a remake      and yet  they go after great works like black christmas  oh well      br

movies that die hard fans of most slasher movies just had to see  well  i rented it and i have to say that although it kept my attention as far as the suspense goes for most slasher films such as  april fools day    friday 13th  and  prom night   this film could have been right up there with the above mentioned only it lacked true enthusiasm and potential from the characters as well as the on going story  characters that i found were unfortunate to be in this movie was the weirdo guy with the frizzy hair that kept creeping around the dorm and of course leading up to his true climatic role during the end with he faces the killer  another would be the dirty scruffy looking guy with the jean jacket  he could have played more roles in this movie that might have made the movie more interesting  instead  the movie played this guy as just another loser out there making unknown calls while he sleeps with his girlfriend and then drops his part and cuts him off until the end which was a waste  i was disappointed in his part in the end  as far as the true identity of the killer goes  when the identity was released as to who he was  i just laughed  but it was all to obvious and he really made a true jerk out of himself as well as an annoying character after his true intentions were revealed  this movie should be one to at least watch once for all slasher fans but don t spend

out a decommissioned dormitory  they become aware that a psychopath is on the loose  to combat this development  they split up and wander about in the dark  it ends in tears for most of them  br    br

again  this film probably has one of the highest percentage of one movie actors in history  of the nineteen credited actors  a whopping thirteen never appeared in any other film  three appeared in one

see this one  originality often isn t one of slasher cinema s strongpoints  and it s something that this film is seriously lacking in  there really isn t much that can said about pranks  so i ll make this quick  the film was one of the 74 films included on the dpp video nasty list  and that was my only reason for seeing it  the plot follows a bunch of kids that stay behind in a dorm at christmas time  as they re in a slasher  someone decides to start picking them off and this leads to one of the dullest mysteries ever seen in a slasher movie  the fact that this movie was on the video nasty list is bizarre because  despite a few gory scenes  this film is hardly going to corrupt or deprave anyone  and gorier slashers than this  friday the 13th  for example  didn t end up banned  but then again  there s banned films that are much less gory than this one  the witch who came from the sea  for example   anyway  the conclusion of the movie is the best thing about it  as although the audience really couldn t care less who the assailant is by this point  it is rather well done  on the whole  this is a dreary and dismal slasher that even slasher fans will do well to miss ',\n  'what the             is this   this must  without a doubt  be the biggest waste of film  settings and camera ever  i know you can t set your expectations for an 80 s slasher high  but this is too stupid to be true  i baught this film for 0 89  and i still feel the urge to go claim my money back  can you imagine who hard it stinks   br    br   who is the violent killer in this film and what are his motivations    well actually  you couldn t possible care less  and why should you  the makers of this piece of garbage sure didn t care  they didn t try to create a tiny bit of tension  the director   stephen carpenter    i guess it s much easier to find money with a name like that   also made the kindred  1986  wich was rather enjoyable and recently he did soul survivors  complete crap as well  but at least that one had eliza dushku  this junk has the debut of daphne zuniga       who      yeah that s right  the melrose place chick  her very memorable character dies about 15 min  after the opening credits  she s the second person to die  the first victim dies directly in the first minute  but nobody seems to mention or miss him afterwards so who cares   the rest of the actors   they don t deserve the term actors actually  are completely uninteresting  you re hoping they die a quick and painful death   and not only their characters br    br   my humble opinion   0   10',\n  'i ve always liked fred macmurray  and\\x97although her career was tragically cut short\\x97i think carole lombard is fun to watch  pair these two major and attractive stars together  add top supporting

yes\\x85it s the true hollywood happy ending  which comes none too soon  br    br   stars and a director of this caliber should guarantee success  but this movie is so predictable and slow paced that it s difficult to watch at times  the early scenes set in panama are so draggy that they seem to go on forever  and later an alcoholic skid just wanders endlessly in new york  fred and carole try their best  but the tired script and s l o w direction just don t give them a chance  even the final scene  in which maggie encourages skid to rise from the ashes of alcohol and disappointment  just doesn t ring true  br    br   this movie should be seen once to watch some early performances from stars macmurray and lombard  however  i guarantee that watching it will seem to take about 48 hours ',\n  'i am a big fan of fred macmurray and carole lombard  and  in addition to them  charles butterworth  a very enjoyable supporting actor  was in this film    so why didn t i particularly enjoy it   well  despite a good cast  this is one of the poorest written and most clichéd  a pictures  i have ever seen  given the talent and money spent to make this film  it is shocking how slip shod the writing was  i knew the film would be tedious when time after time early in the film i found myself predicting exactly what would happen next  and i was always right  and this isn t because i am some sort of  movie savant   but was because almost no imagination or effort went into it  in fact  it seemed almost as if the film was just a long string of clichés all strung together  also  i found it a bit irritating that fred mistreated carole so bad throughout the film and yet  true to convention  she came running to him in the end  uggh  there is more suspense in a lassie film   will he bring people to rescue timmy or will the rope he is dangling from break     br    br   despite the very  very tired and clichéd script  there were a few positives about the film  it was pretty cool seeing fred look like a broken lush at the end of the film  it was pretty believable and he looked like he hadn t eaten  shaved or slept in days  also  charles butterworth s  prattle  did provide a few mildly humorous moments  but all this just wasn t enough to make this film look any different than a  b movie   it s a shame    it could have been so much better ',\n  'in what would be his first screenplay  based on his own short story  turn about   william faulkner delivers a bizarre story of loyalty  sacrifice  and really strange relationships  the story originally was about only the tone  young  and cooper characters  but mgm needed to put joan crawford in another picture to fulfill her contract  and faulkner obliged by creating a female role  crawford insisted that her lines be written in the same clipped style as her co stars  young and tone  leading to much unintentional hilarity as these three communicate in a telegraph like shorthand that sounds like a monty python sketch   wuthering heights  performed in semaphore   seriously  the almost entirely pronoun less sentences make ernest hemingway read like henry james  br    br   the film also reflects some familiar faulkner themes  with an almost unnaturally close relationship between brother and sister  as may be found in his  sanctuary   and elsewhere   when young proposes to crawford  in tone s presence  in lieu of an engagement ring all three exchange their childhood engraved rings with one another  the closeness of tone and young is also noticeable  especially as they go off to their thelma   louise fate  frankly  it s creepy  br    br   not as creepy to this new yorker  however  as the recurring theme of the massive cockroach  wellington  which crawford cheerfully catches  and which is shown gamboling over her hands  i had to turn away   and young turns into a gladiator  blech  br    br   that being said  there are some nice performances  young is particularly engaging in a scene where he s taken up in cooper s fighter plane  and roscoe karns is delightful as cooper s flying buddy  tone  despite his inability to express himself through realistic dialogue  has a nice moment  dashing away his own furtive tears over his buddy young s fate  crawford  stripped of meaningful dialogue as well  mostly comes across as either wooden or melodramatic  which is quite a balancing act for one role  br    br   the battle scenes  not surprisingly  for a howard hawks film  are the most exciting part of the entire picture  but not enough  as far as i m concerned  this is 75 minutes of my life i m never going to get back ',\n  'my wife and i thought that with this cast and director  the movie would have to be at least worth watching  we were wrong  in fact  we gave up on it after 45 minutes  the idea that crawford  young and tone are british but speak with american accents was  for me  impossible to get past    hard to believe this is england when no one talks with a british accent  there is zero chemistry between crawford and anyone  and to echo a previous comment  the idea that cooper and crawford suddenly declare their love for one another without any reason is ludicrous  there is no reason to care about any of the characters  which is why we threw in the towel halfway through  i found it hard to believe that hawks directed this  as none of the actors spoke with the trademark hawksian rat a tat delivery  so save your time  and skip this one ',\n  'couldn t believe it  clipped sentences  good grief  know what  all true  real people ever talk like this  don t think so  good girl  stout fellow  stiffen upper lip  only reason given movie 2 instead of 0 gary cooper such a dish  movie as a whole ridiculous unless you like watching endless biplane dogfights  seemed endless  anyway  think all franchot tone s dialogue dubbed  when crawford and young make a special effort to sound british they come over as irish  handy tip   we brits clip words  not sentences  and somehow we manage to draaaaaaaawl at the same time  but that s only if we ve been to a really good public  that s private to you  school ',\n  'lulu  louise brooks  works as a typist and is missing

has been added on afterwards and it is very phony  the cast are alright bearing in mind that it is a silent film  the best part of the film comes at the end but the story goes on a little too long  after watching this  i m not really sure what the big deal was over the looks of louise brooks   she has a terrible haircut that makes her face look fat  i don t need to watch it again ',\n  'please note  i see from the various posts that there was an original silent version and also a sound version of this same film  i saw the sound version and it was esthetically yicky  considering some indicate that the original version was longer and without crappy dubbing  my review must be read with this in mind  br    br   although i know that rene clair has a lovely reputation as a film maker and louise brooks has a bit of a cult following as well  this is in many ways a technically poorly made film  while hollywood had already pretty much switched to sound mode around 1929  up through the early to almost the mid 30s  a lot of famous french films were essentially silent films  with some dialog and sound effects very poorly slapped over top the film  the lip movements in many  and in particular this film  don t even come close to matching what is being said and this would explain why an american like ms  brooks could do a french film  this is just sloppy and i would have preferred they had just made a silent film  and as a silent film this is would have been an average film  with excellent camera work  at times  and some decent silent style acting  br    br   the problem i also found with the film was the overly simplistic plot  for a silent morality play circa 1920  it would have been fine  but by 1930 standards the plot is a bit hoary  that means  old   not  slutty    a lady wins a beauty contest and her macho fiancé can t handle it  she gives it all up  temporarily  but is lured back to the fancy life and this spells her end  a tad melodramatic  huh  and also a bit simplistic and underdeveloped  br    br   finally  the character of the fiancé s friend    i found very disturbing and unreal  he looked like harold lloyd and spent much of the movie being abused and picked on by the friend and everyone else  as he just took it throughout the movie and no resolution came about  his character seemed superfluous and the treatment he received mean spirited  were audiences supposed to laugh as he was abused  this seems to me that s what is implied and i don t like it at all  br    br   there are far better french films of the era  le million  la femme du boulanger  fanny  regain  and others  as well as better silent films  i just can t understand this film s high rating ',\n  'this review may contain some spoilers  br    br   just when you thought they didn t make them so extremely bad anymore  along comes rae dawn chong as a space vixen and willie nelson as a native american witchdoctor  it s even worse when you factor in that these two are the better aspects of  starlight   a film that should only be viewed for laughs  br    br   chong is an alien sent to earth to seek out the only remaining half breed  part man and part alien  apparently  the earth is in dire straits  something is wrong with the genetics of mankind  and in a few decades the world will be turned into a polluted wasteland  only by duplicating the dna of the half breed can the kindly alien race save the planet  don t ask me how that is  since the movie gives the impression that the world will be destroyed by pollution  which is caused by humans  you would think earth could only be saved by getting rid of the polluting creatures  not saving them  anyway  the half breed turns out to be billy wirth  a man living in a small southwestern town and is part native american from his mother s line  despite the fact that his mother is a red headed caucasian and his grandfather is willie nelson  wasn t this the sort of malarkey that made the bombastic carmen electra bomb  the chosen one  such a howler  chong arrives in her ship just as wirth nearly drowns after driving his motorcycle into a lake in a fit of recklessness being the result of just breaking up with his girlfriend  before you can say utter the word  hogwash   chong is revealing her secret to wirth  who isn t surprised for a moment  and spreading the word to wirth s family  chong also makes pals with wirth s mother  who seems to have lost a few of her marbles over the years  well  this is because wirth s father was an alien that abandoned her  of course  he is the standard rogue alien that has conveniently picked this moment to come to earth for wirth so he can use wirth s dna to make the people of earth his slaves   huh   his laughable attempts to use his telepathic powers and capture wirth suck up most of the screen time and are the worst scenes in the movie  not only are they boring  but they are the scenes where you will be spotting the flubs the most  br    br   the ideas might be nice on paper  but they are handled here with the utmost of stupidity  particularly in the aforementioned scenes with the rogue alien  but the effects are the bane of the movie  the opening scene involves chong on her spaceship  communicating with her superior  someone who we do not see but that chong communicates with through a vat that emits pink light  they use no spoken words  but telepathy  so we are treated to subtitles  trouble is  both chong and her superior s subtitles both look alike  and the director gives you no indication as to which of the two are actually  speaking  at any given moment  which makes the whole conversation nothing but gibberish  the spaceship is the worst effect to come out of hollywood this side of an ed wood film  now  i am usually lenient on effects when dealing with a low budgeted film such as this  but these effects really got to me  the most offensive was the most simple one  a fake night sky  the stars in the sky are so phony they almost sound off a dial tone  most notably are the moments where chong tells someone she comes from pleiades  and we get a shot of the seven stars  thing is  the seven stars take up about half the night sky in the movie  but any stargazer knows that pleiades is a star cluster between the constellations perseus and taurus  and the cluster doesn t take up much room in the sky at all  these effects just get so lousy that your jaw will hang lower and lower with every passing moment  be careful  for it will go right through the floor during the finale when the effects have willie nelson turn into a human spotlight and       oh  it has to be seen to be believed  br    br   starlight  star bright  last star i see tonight  i wish i might  i wish i may  not have to watch any more

incredibly hokey special effects  check out the laser beams shooting out of willie s eyes    the atrocious acting  the ponderous dialogue  the mismatched use of stock footage  or the air of earnest pretentiousness that infuses the entire production  this truly is a one of a kind experience  and we should all be thankful for that  i nominate jonathon kay as the true heir to ed wood ',\n  'this

direction consistent with her talent ',\n  'all i can really say is that i m glad that i was knitting socks while watching the movie  or i would be very angry for having wasted 2 hours of my life  the acting was terrible  the plot was even worse  there were some scenes that were meant to be serious that had my husband and i laughing out loud  i highly recommend this movie to people who like to do their own version of mst3k ',\n  'i shudder to think what people must have thought of environmentalists after viewing this piece of overbearing  preachy cinematic trash  larded with enough indian

so much like a refugee from a castro street bar  fortunately  they ve got mystical grandpa willie nelson along to help  who looks faintly embarrassed by the proceedings  as well he ought to be  along with buckets of cheap f x and reams of pointlessly swelling music  br    br   sure  the clunky script helps to obscure the film s trite plot and staggering pace  but that s just the tip of this melting movie iceberg  everyone concerned with this film should have their union cards revoked until they complete a real course in environmental science ',\n  'i wanted to see it because of two reasons  one  it was the remake of high sierra with bogart  two  the bogart part was played by jack palance  whom can play dramatic roles with some subtility  as in the big knife  br    br   but now i wonder why they decided to shoot this remake  the film follows the same plot as hig sierra  only here  the actors don t care  the director is lost in his thoughts  and who knows what the producer was thinking  jack palance is getting bored looking at shelley winters and shelley winters is asking herself what she s doing in this film  i don t even want to compare her to ida lupino in the same role  and of course  they had to use the dog story again  they surely could have come up with some different ideas  perhaps the color makes it nice to see the same location where they shot high sierra  but that definitely doesn t add any quality to the film  br    br   it s a waste of time if you ve seen high sierra before  otherwise  why not see a pseudo film noir  as for me  i d rather die than see it

'i am the guy who usually keeps opinions to himself  but i just got back from this movie  and felt i had to express my opinions  let me start by saying that i am a huge horror fan  but what makes a horror movie  i sure like to see even a tiny bit of a good script and character development  i know they often lack in horror movies  but prom night looked like it didn t even put forth any effort in that department  next  we all love suspense  that on the edge of your seat suspense with unpredictable surprises  yeah  prom night had none of that  of course  we like a terrifying killer  prom night have that  nope  it has a pretty boy with a cute lil  knife  and when all else fails   at least horror has its guilty pleasure to make it enjoyable like gore gore gore  and the occasional nude scene  yeah  well when you have a horror movie rated pg 13 like prom night  they leave that stuff out too  so with all of these elements missing  i ask    does this still count as a horror movie  nope  i d call it more of a comedy  people in my theater were laughing more at this then they were when i saw  semi pro  that was supposed to actually be a comedy  which also sucked  but thats another story    i think i am just going to have to give up on new horror  all the good horror movies of the good ol  days have been remade into garbage so movie studios can make money  the people i went to see it with didn t even know this was a remake  which made me mad  i wonder what will happen when there s no more movies to remake    where will horror go next   ',\n  'so  prom night was supposed to be a horror and thriller movie  i m a big wuss and was scared to see this movie at the beginning  but upon seeing it  it is neither horror or thriller  br    br   i was basically making fun of the movie in my seat because it was so predictable  you could predict what was going to happen next  the young actors were alright at playing their characters  but i d have to say the killer was definitely at the top of the game   acting wise  br    br   yes  i ll give props for the plot because it was good  but it s not thrilling or scary  there were almost zero  jump in your seat  scenes  so  don t waste ten dollars seeing it in theatres  wait  til it comes to dvd ',\n  'when i first saw the trailer for prom night  i have to admit  the trailer looked good and like this would be a fun horror movie  so my friend and i saw prom night last night and i have to say i must be growing up because this was such a ridicules film  not to mention i am so sick and tired of the typical horror slasher movies with the loud noises as an excuse to scare people  there was no tension  the characters  how was i supposed to care about them  they had no development what so ever  the killer   oh  my god  this was very possibly the most stupid serial killer that has ever existed  i know it s a film  but why would a man who never or at least we know of  killed any one before  kill a girl s family and friends that he s just obsessed over  i mean  was he going to kidnap her or was he going to kill her  i have no idea  because this film made no sense and is too predictable and insulting to true fans of horror  br    br   donna s family was just brutally murdered by her teacher  who has become very obsessed over her  he was captured and put in jail  it s been 3 years and she s just now getting some peace in her life  she s even going to her senior prom  but the killer has escaped and still has donna on his mind  he follows her to her prom which means bad news for her friends  and the hotel maid  and the bell boy  because it is such a good idea to kill the maid and bell boy so no one become suspicious enough to check to see where these employee s are  donna is in big trouble because also this killer who is clearly human can apparently get into houses un noticed and can kill people so silently  just  wow  br    br   i m sorry  i really did want to love this movie  we haven t had a good slasher flick in a long time  but this was just a stupid movie that i was not impressed with  just the situations were unbelievable and the actors were obnoxious  i know that this was a pg 13 movie  but i just love how someone was brutally stabbed to death and they only have just a little blood on their clothes  not to mention no stab holes  i wouldn t recommend this movie for anyone unless you re a teen  this movie was made for the teenagers  not adults  and not for those who know a real horror movie  no offense to those who did enjoy this film  but i don t understand how anyone could  br    br   2 10',\n  'i saw this trailer and thought to myself my god is this movie for real  who would want to see this movie and at the same time i thought that  my girl friend turned to me and said  we have to go see this movie    enough said so i saw this about 5 minutes go and i tried to put on a brave face and enjoy the cheap scares but there weren t even any of those  it has to be one of the worst movies i have ever seen the director has no influence no perspective the same shots were used again and again he did not build up suspense the cast probably were simply told scream cry run fall  i would love to see the script as the first 40 mins was mostly annoying girly giggles and bad music  there was absolutely no character development  br    br   the plot is just   well there was no plot it was basically i know we will terrorize a high school group on their prom night with a stalker serial killer  that s brilliant  hmmm the acting was what you expect in a australian soap opera hopeless  that main character the blondie god dam she annoyed me  her longest line must have been half a sentence  and every time she was on camera she was just pulling another rude facial expression  br    br   please listen to me if you have any taste in movies don t go see this  and if your like me and don t have a choice well then i wish you good luck  maybe smuggle in an ipod or magazine  can t believe this film got made ',\n  'in bridgeport  the deranged high school teacher richard fenton  johnathon schaech  is obsessed by the teenager student donna keppel  brittany snow   she witnesses him murder her family to stay with her  but richard is arrested and sent to prison for life  three years later  the traumatized donna is feeling better but is still under psychological treatment and taking pills  on her prom night  she goes with her boyfriend bobby  scott porter  and two couples of friends to the pacific grad hotel for the party  but the psychopath richard has escaped from prison and is lodged in the same floor in the hotel chasing donna  stabbing her friends and staff of the hotel that cross his path  br    br   the forgettable slash  prom night  is a collection of clichés with a total lack of originality  the stupid story is shallow and silly  with a bad acting of johnathon schaech in the role of an insane killer  the predictable screenplay is amazing since it is possible to foresee what is going to happen in the next scenes  my vote is three  br    br   title  brazil    a morte convida para dançar    the death invites to dance  ',\n  'i m not particularly fond of remakes  or to steal the modern jargon  retellings   but this film truly peeved me off  the original prom night  while not in my humble estimation a masterpiece  still realized what it was    horror  there are some simple things to remember when making a horror film  suspense is crucial to maintaining the interest of the audience  sorry folks  but a white knuckle film this was not  the scares were cheap  and foreshadowed terribly   a good example of scare which has been done to clichéd excess now  is the cat jumping out of the closet  followed soon there after but a now unexpected appearance by the villain of the film  this film couldn t successfully pull that off  so how could i expect it to fulfill any of the other conventions of horror film  there needs to be a likable hero or heroine  this film doesn t have one  the person i most identified with was the head detective  his calm demeanor  but level headed approach to the escape of a killer was what more films of this ilk should have  common sense approach to events that occur   if you re running from an axe wielding psycho  you turn and sprint in the opposite direction  not jog  whilst looking back ever three seconds  gaging the killer s progress  only to trip over every branch and inanimate object in your path   if you friend disappears  you don t go looking for them alone  and if you suspect foul play you tell someone  not investigate yourself  these clichés are tired and well overplayed  in the horror genre in general  and in this film in particular ',\n  'imagine the scenario   you are at the movie theater only because you are in washington for the weekend and it s raining and you re finished with the museums  you think you might go see the sarah marshall movie as the trailer look so so and you don t have to engage your brain  it s sold out  options    the bank job  in bruges  the leatherheads or prom night  you ve seen the bank job  suprisingly decent heist movie that  and in bruges  again  pretty good  so you re down to two  you don t fancy watching clooney or the nice one from the office run around in 1930 football uniforms  so you go see prom night right  wrong  you take the  8 50  walk up to a stranger in the street and ask him to punch you in the face for  8 50  it would be money better spent  br    br   it actually plays like more of a comedy than a horror thriller or whatever it is supposed to be  if i was financing that movie and they showed me that as a final cut i wouldn t know whether to laugh or cry  probably both  an insult to anyone s intelligence    my roommate was laughing out loud most of the movie  as for the acting  they might as well have cast robots  or maybe dogs  in the roles  they would have been more realistic  the detective has to be possibly the worst actor i have ever seen  ben affleck and hayden christansan  i hate his acting so much i don t care how you spell his name  you are relieved on your title s    br    br   so in summary  not good ',\n  'and rent a good horror movie  it s like the writer had never seen a horror movie before and didn t realize every single thing he wrote was clichéd and hackneyed and has been parodied to perfection in movies like  scream  and  scary movie   br    br   in between the scary bits is the most banal and boring dialog ever written  stupid  we re going to the prom  junk  i wanted to claw my ears off  honestly   the hills  has better dialog  br    br   there really was no need to make this movie  leading lady is uninteresting and i kept thinking  her  really  guy is obsessed with her  really    br    br   all the characters act in stupid ways  including the police   cover the place in teams of 2  front and back  not one sleepy cop sitting in his car with the window rolled down just waiting for his throat to be slashed    br    br   the serial killer just swans about murdering everyone he wants without the least bit of problem  no resistance from victims  or doors   nobody has any protection or the least idea of fighting back  or flipping the security lock on the hotel room door   the people are like mentally disabled sheep  br    br   by the by  if you re a gore fan  you ll be disappointed too  all the killing is kept offscreen and is    ahem    tastefully done   so boo hoo for you    br    br   none of the killings is the least bit interesting  most of the time they ve already happened by the time we find out  br    br   the only cliché missing was the cat that always pops out in this kind of movies   oh kitty  you scared me  i thought you were the killer    aiieeee    br    br   and then at the end when it s time for the killer to die    well  let s just say it s the easiest and most obvious choice  snore  br    br   the audience was jeering and talking back to the screen throughout  it was too dumb to believe and not really scary enough  don t encourage this kind of lazy film making  br    br    oh  and by the way    no crowning of a prom king or queen  no tiara  no bucket of blood    br    br   so save your money and rent  carrie  or  friday the 13th  or  halloween  or  scream  or  scary movie   any of them  to get a good scare with some original twists ',\n  'okay  so i just got back  before i start my review  let me tell you one thing  i wanted to like this movie  i know i ve been negative in the past  but i was hoping to be surprised and actually come out liking the film  i didn t  br    br   it s not just the fact that every horror cliché imaginable is in this  and it s not just the fact that they make every little thing into a jump scare  walking into a baseball bat left on the floor  are you kidding me    it just wasn t scary  one thing i was surprised about  there was more blood than i thought there was going to be   which isn t saying much  br    br   the film starts off with donna being dropped off by lisa s mom at her house  she comes in   goes upstairs  camera pans to her father dead on the couch  spooky  she goes upstairs  where the aforementioned baseball bat scene happens  finds her brother on his bed  apparently dead  how could she tell  he didn t have a spot of blood on him   killer comes in  donna hides under bed  mom dies  she runs outside screaming for help  killer behind her   i did it for us   cut to therapy session  this confused a lot of people  everyone was asking whether or not her family actually died or if she imagined it  and she mentions how the nightmares have started coming back  filler dialogue ensues  br    br   they cut to the chase pretty quick  few scenes at the salon  they go to the hotel  of course the killer is already there  for some reason  he escaped 3 days ago but the police family weren t informed until he s already there   more filler ensues  br    br   i m not going to go on about what happens in the film  because i don t want to spoil it too much  if you want to know who dies  horror fan made a post about it already  but on the subjects of deaths  they weren t that exciting  people in the theatre actually laughed out loud  an experience i ve never had before in a horror movie  not even in when a stranger calls  during several of them  one in particular  the bus boy guy who gives the most hilarious  scared  face i ve ever seen  the only death involving any blood was lisa s  and that was pretty scarce  her throat is slashed  blood  if you can even call it that  it was practically black  splatters on the curtain thing  the only other blood was on claire when we see her body  apparently  fenton decided to stab her a few times after he choked her to death  um  okay  the movie was one of the most clichéd i ve ever seen  let s see here   obligatory close mirror curtain boom  scene  check  twice  actually  you could tell they were struggling   mandatory backing up into killer  check  there s also the backing up into lamp scene  but you ve all seen that  oh  you say you want a birds flying away scare  well  you got it   yes  they managed to incorporate one of those in here   and  of course  the we have security on all exits but he still escaped scene  shall i go on  i could  br    br   for anyone saying the characters weren t stupid  are you kidding me   oh  even though the massive alarm is ringing  literally saying please vacate the building  and 3 of my friends are missing  i m going to go upstairs to get my wrap   these characters were some of the most flawed and stupid characters ever  the only likable character   lisa   made one of the most stupid moves in the movie   oh  i just realized the psycho teacher is here  i must leave my strong boyfriend behind to run off by myself to warn her  oh  shoot  the elevator is being to slow  guess i ll take the stairs and run off into the construction site   ugh  by the end of the film  they all deserved to die  the only death anyone felt any remorse for was donna s boyfriend  i can t even remember his name  is that bad    and by that time  the audience was completely drained out of this scareless  clichéd film  br    br   there were some positives  the acting was decent for the most part  and it was well shot  but that s about it  br    br   i d give it a 1 5  and that s being generous  just for the laughs  and believe me  the audience had a few   and brittany snow  br    br   oh  and the reaction was bad  very bad  people were boo ing after the movie ended and buzz afterwards was very negative  expect bad legs for this one ',\n  'good grief i can t even begin to describe how poor this film is  don t get me wrong  i wasn t expecting much to begin with  let s face it  a pg 13 slasher flick is pre destined to be missing the ummm    slashing  so no one should be surprised by the lack of gore  but it was the level of incompetence and cliché on display in all the other aspects of this movie is what really blew me away   br    br   we have a protagonist who is quite simply so completely useless that you find yourself rooting for the bad guy  and here s a turnup for the books    she never changes   hence breaking the cardinal rule of basic screen writing   character development  if you think by the end of this film the poor little girl is going to turn around and finally kick some arse then think again   br    br   on top of this  we re handed possibly the least intriguing  and definitely the least scary  killer ever to grace the genre  i m not joking when i say that dora the explorer has scarier villains than this movie  br    br   finally  because all the potential for tension or gratuity is removed by the inept  and apparently thirteen year old  director  what could possibly be left to fill up 2 hours of screen time   br    br   closets  that s what   br    br   lots and lots of closets  big closets  small closets  mirrored closets  closets to narnia  so many damned closets you ll not want to dress yourself for another year  in fact this movie should have just been called  closet   and had a picture of a big scary coathanger on the dvd case  on the back it could have had a photograph of the audience falling asleep and a quote by roger and ebert   something to the extent of   what the f    did we just waste our time watching  ',\n  'this movie is a good example of the extreme lack of good writers and directors in hollywood  the fact that people were paid to make this piece of junk shows that there is a lack of original ideas and talent in the entertainment business  the idea that audiences paid to see this movie  and like an idiot i rented the film  is discouraging also  br    br   obsessed teacher  3 years prior  kills teenager s family because he wants her  for no reason he kills the mother  father and brother  from the first five minutes you see the bad acting and direction  years later  obsessed teacher breaks out of prison  hmm  usual bad writing  no one in the town he terrorized knows until the last minute  obsessed teacher somehow becomes like a navy seal and can sneak around  sniff out people and with a knife is super killer  sure    now obsessed teacher kills hotel maid for no reason  knifes bellhop for the fun of it  and starts to hunt down the teenager s friends  now there is the perfect way to get the girl to love you  obsessed teacher sneaks out of hotel   again it is stupid  ever cop would know his face  but he walks right by them  now he kills two cops outside teenager s house and somehow sneaks into her bedroom and kills her boyfriend  br    br   there is not one single positive thing about this piece of garbage  if any other profession put out work of this low quality  they would be fired  yet these idiots are making hundreds of thousands of dollars for writing and directing this trash ',\n  'i wish i could give this movie a zero out of ten  before going to this movie the day after it came out  i came on imdb to check out the comments  a comment called the movie predictable and cheesy with terrible dialog  i never go by other people s opinions  so i wasted seven dollars for this crap movie  it had to be one of the worst movies i ve ever seen  br    br   the person who wrote the script should be pushed off a cliff  since when do scary movies have sappy scenes  i swear  i m amazed there weren t any group hug     moments  br    br   i think i jumped  once  and that s because i zoned out  thinking about my research paper for english  the clichéd  birds cat popping out of nowhere thing when you thought something was gonna happen  br    br   and the characters were stupid  my friend and i almost died laughing when the alarm went off and the main character said   i have to get my mom s shawl     you  idiot  screw the shawl  safety is just a few steps away  but no  my mom s shawl  that didn t match the dress by the way  is wayyyy more important than my health and safety  and to top it all off  they take her back to her house  knowing that the killer knew where she lived  god  br    br   my friend and i also predicted the entire movie  and not just the  i bet he s hiding under the bed  moments  it was the   he stole the bellhop s clothes and sneaked out of the hotel  and  it s the detective coming down the hallway  not the killer   moments  movies should never be this predictable  disney movies aren t even this predictable  br    br   i m gonna complete my rant now by saying  this was a terrible movie  i m glad i went to see it in theaters so i wouldn t buy it for  15 00 and then hate it  it was just bad  it would ve been better if only one thing would ve happened  if  after being shot by the detective  the killer would have fallen down in the same position he got shot in  knife in hand  falling and stabbing the girl on his way down  oh  how lovely that would ve been  br    br   don t waste your time or money  go see a good movie ',\n  'prom night  2008  br    br   directed by  nelson mccormick br    br   starring  brittany snow  scott porter  jessica stroup  and dana davis br    br   plot  three years ago  donna  brittany snow  witnessed the death of her entire family at the hands of her teacher  jonathan schaech  who has a bit of a crush on her  now  she is preparing for her senior prom with her stupid annoying friends  once there  they start dying one by one because the killer escaped from prison and no one bothered to warn donna because apparently her prom is too important to interrupt   br    br   pros  i got a few good laughs out of the film due to the terrible dialog and the dumb character moves  br    br   an example  br    br   everyone decides not to tell donna that the man who is oddly obsessed with her  she doesn t seem that great  has escaped from prison  their reason  they don t want to embarrass her in front of all her friends  lol br    br   cons  let me start off by saying i m a huge slasher fan  usually i can have fun with even the bad ones  i even like some pg 13 horror films  tourist trap  1979   one of my favorites  was originally rated pg  i also enjoy poltergeist  1982  and the grudge  2004   so the fact that this is a dumb slasher film that is rated pg 13 does not have anything to do with me not enjoying the movie  br    br   first of all  i had a big problem with the story  i like slasher films that don t even have stories  at least they can be entertaining  this is about a teacher who falls in love with his student  so he kills her entire family  a few years later  he tries to make it up to her by ruining her prom and killing all of her friends      then there were subplots that i doubt anyone cared about  claire  jessica stroup  is fighting with her boyfriend  she has cramps  and i couldn t care less  this should have been a lifetime feature  not a remake of prom night   br    br   and then     this is a slasher film with terrible death scenes  i don t even care that it s not that gory  some of my favorite slashers  halloween  curtains  the original prom night  were not that gory but they still had effective murders  here  we have half the characters dying in the same hotel room off screen  a woman being stabbed several times with no stab wounds  and a closeup on a bad actor s face as he screams in agony  i m sure that 10 year old girls were terrified  but not me  br    br   i also hated the characters  there was donna s unrealistically sensitive boyfriend bobby  scott porter  and i can almost guarantee you will never meet a boyfriend that sensitive in your life  unless you are a gay male  then we had donna s annoying friends claire  stroup  and lisa  dana davis   and the token mean girl chrissy  brianne davis   if you thought the characters in death proof were annoying  try watching this movie  and don t get me started on ronnie  collins pennie  and the dj  jay phillips  who gave me flashbacks to usher s performance in she s all that  br    br   add to all that predictable plot turns  a terrible soundtrack and a big lack of respect to the original material  and you have quite a stinker ',\n  'note  i couldn t force myself to actually write up a constructive review of prom night  it just can t be done  instead  i went through what i thought about while watching the movie  br    br   things that i thought about while watching prom night   br    br    i m so tired of those dreams where these elaborate deaths will take place  only for the main character to wake up right before she bites it  of course  when i say  elaborate deaths   i mean off screen throat slashes or stabs in the stomach  didn t the whole  it s just a dream  thing get ruined by dallas  speaking of which  i wonder if a couple stabs in the gut will cause immediate death  br    br    the film is only ten minutes into and i can already count the horror clichés on two hands  not a good sign  br    br    even after just meeting the protagonist s boyfriend  i m convinced he will die  anybody want to place bets   br    br    the killer in this movie is a teacher that is obsessed with the main character  donna   by the way  does anybody think that  donna  is a horrible name for a main character in a horror film   he spends three years in a maximum security prison before breaking out and finds donna celebrating her high school prom  while there is no accounting for taste  i seriously wonder who would take all that time to stalk somebody as dull as donna  br    br    high schools allow proms to take place at hotels and doesn t keep track of the students  apparently students are perfectly able to buy a hotel room and go in and out as they please  i suppose if this plot point wasn t in place  the movie would be 90 minutes of people being bored out of their mind and randomly biting the dust whenever they go to the bathroom  i suppose the trade off for their excitement is my utter boredom with everything  i ve already played  count the pieces of chewed bubble gum under the seat  and  guess how much money i have in my wallet  and i m only in the 20 minute mark  how else will i entertain myself   br    br    note to self  don t forget milk and bread on the way home  br    br    dear screenwriter  you ve used up enough false scares to get through this movie and every other horror remake this year  br    br    the 1980 version of this film wasn t that good but compared to this remake it was like citizen kane  or at least the godfather  it had jamie lee curtis in one of her many post halloween horror flicks and it did have a little  twist  at the end  i miss jamie lee  i wish she d act more  br    br    apparently at prom there isn t much dancing going on  instead the girls get in fights with their boyfriends over where they plan to attend college  i hear all these colleges being brought up by name  and i can t help but wonder who these girls have to cheat off of on the entrance exam to get in  br    br    the killer must carry a bag of really effective cleaning supplies and wipes up his mess between scenes  that s the only logical explanation for why he could stab somebody to death on the carpet or in the bathroom and by the time somebody goes up to the hotel room  there is no trace of a struggle   on another side note  this is a very lazy killer  michael myers went hunting after his victims  just saying   br    br    it s official  the entire audience in the theater is rooting on the killer  what triggered it  was it whenever donna went back up to her hotel room while sirens were going off ordering everybody to exit the building  was it her constant dreams  and how even after going through something dramatic in said dream she insisted on reenacting her steps to a tee  or was it brittany snow s unconvincing performance  i ll have to say it was all of the above  br    br    okay  who had  he dies off screen in the third act   you win the pot  br    br    finally  the movie is over  my friend turns to me and says  donna wasn t too smart   that s the understatement of the week  kind of like saying that a tornado is a small gust of wind  or a week long power outage is a slight inconvenience  br    br    i can t wait to get on rotten tomatoes and see if anybody gave this move a favoring review  br    br    i can t recommend this  i refuse to recommend this  this is as lazy of a horror film as any  and the only way to enjoy its cheese smelling plot is if you are under the influence of at least ten beers  and unfortunately for theater patrons  alcohol isn t served  br    br   rating    out of     ',\n  'i went into this with my hopes up  by twenty minutes into the movie i couldn t have been more let down  despite thinking that this would be another horribly bad remake  i kept my hopes high that maybe   just maybe someone would get it right this time around  sadly  prom night is about on the same quality level as the recent april fools day remake  bad script  bad direction  cheesy overdone acting and generally bad horror  br    br   from beginning to end it s boring  repetitive and worthy of about a dozen eye rolls  we ve seen it all before and we ve seen it done a million times better then this  if you go to see prom night in the theater  i d say wait for the dvd or ppv   get ready for the audience to laugh  because laugh they will  the laughs aren t at points in the movie that are supposed to be funny  they are in response to key  thrilling  moments in the film that are so poorly done you feel as if your watching the newest installment of scary movie  seriously  was this supposed to be a remake or a spoof  the film makers missed the mark so badly here  that a large number of the audience in the theater i attended walked out about halfway through the movie  which in retrospect  i wish i had done  not me though  i had to torture myself and stick with it hoping it would get better  needless to say it didn t  the  horror  scenes are a joke  not even so much because of the acting but because of the direction  the script  the  special effects  and the camera work  the movie manages to look as if they spent a fortune to produce it  but still came out of it with a micro budget movie  i halfway expected to see dollar store tags on some of the props and kept thinking i would spot a porn star in the cast somewhere   br    br   this movies scary alright  if this is the future of big budget horror then the horror genre is doomed ',\n  ' prom night  is a title only remake of the 1980 slasher flick that starred jamie lee curtis and leslie nielsen  this movie takes place in an oregon town  where donna  brittany snow  is about to go to her senior prom and let herself have some fun after going through some extremely traumatic events in the past few years  she and her friends arrive at the prom  which is taking place in a grand hotel  and try and enjoy what is supposed to be the most fun night of their lives  little does anyone know  a man from donna s past  who has haunted her for years  is also at the prom    and is willing to kill anyone in way of his pursuit of her  br    br   i m a fan of the original  prom night   so i tried to maintain a little hope in this movie  but i have to admit i was quite disappointed   prom night  suffers from the worst affliction a horror movie could have  and that is predictability  there are absolutely no surprises here  and i felt i had seen everything in this movie done dozens of times  often better  before  what does this equate to for the audience  boredom  unless of course you have never seen any horror movies  or are part of the pre teen crowd  but the majority of the audience will most likely be able to guess nearly everything that is going to happen  the plot is simplistic  but the entire script is void of any type of surprise  twist  atmosphere  or anything  and this really  really hurts the movie because it never really gives the audience anything to sink their teeth into  it all just seemed very bland  br    br   a lot of people seem to complain with the fact that this is a pg 13 slasher movie as well  and i understand what they are saying  but i don t think it s impossible to make a good slasher movie with minimal gore  take carpenter s  halloween  for example   little to no on screen violence  but still an extremely frightening and effective movie  you don t need gore to make a film scary  but even had  prom night  been gratuitously violent  which it is not  it is very tame   it still would have added little to the movie because there is not much in the script to build on to begin with  the tension and suspense here is mild at best  and i spent most of the movie predicting the outcome of situations  and was correct about 99  of the time  our characters aren t well written enough either for the audience to make any connection to them  and their by the numbers demises are routine and careless  br    br   i will point out a few things i did like about this movie  though  because it wasn t completely useless   the cinematography is really nice  and everything was very well filmed and fairly stylish  among the  jump  scares  that are for the most part very predictable   there were a few that were kind of clever  the sets for the movie are nice too and the hotel is a neat place for the plot to unfold  however predictable the unfolding may be  as for the acting  it s mediocre at best  brittany snow plays the lead decently  but really the rest of the cast doesn t show off much talent  johnathan schaech plays the villain  and is probably the most experienced performer here  but even he isn t that impressive  however  i did like the character he played  which was a nice change from the typical  masked stalker  type killer we see a lot  as far as the ending goes  the last fifteen minutes of the film had me bored to my wit s end and it was very anti climactic  br    br   overall   prom night  was a disappointment  everything was very by the numbers  routine  and predictable  which is somewhat upsetting considering this had the potential to be a decent slasher movie  there were a few neat moments  but the movie lacked any suspense or atmosphere  and had little plot development  nor believable characters  i d advise seasoned horror fans to save their money and wait till it s out on video  or rent the original instead  because there are absolutely no surprises here  some may find a little entertainment in it  but it was far too predictable for my tastes  i expected better  and left the theater very disappointed  3 10 ',\n  'if i could give this film a real rating  it would likely be in the minus numbers  while i respect the fact that somebody has to keep making these terrible  horror  films  seriously  people  buying a ticket for this film is a waste of money you could be spending on something far more worth your time  br    br   despite it being a horror film  there is nothing scary about it  unless the idea of seeing how many horror cliché s you can fit in one movie scares you  if the rating had been higher  it probably would have made for a better film in the long run  br    br   whoever made this version of  prom night   you screwed up  the actors could probably have done a decent job if it weren t for the questionable scripting  this was a terrible waste of a cinema trip  i d sooner go and see  one missed call  again  at least that had some plot ',\n  'i think it was an overrated pg 13 crap  at least brittany snow s performance was good and some others like idris elba were good too  but some others teens in the prom like the leads friends were not that convincing  the killer was so dumb and looked so stupid too  the deaths were stupid  boring and completely unoriginals  the movie was very boring too and very overrated  it wasn t suspenseful at all  i almost fall asleep  its another bad pg 13 remake  its really a dreadful movie imo  the ending was so stupid and the climax was very rushed and boring  the movie is pretty slow too  overall the only good thing about this crap fest is maybe brittany snow i think she gave a good performance and idris elba too  but besides that it was a completely dreadful movie and horrible remake  well thats just my opinion  i gave it a 2 10 ',\n  'i saw this movie a few days ago and gamely jumped during the scary parts  i must admit  i found it pretty decent   until i started to think about what the characters were saying  logical problems  br    br   1  her boyfriend  who seems to be a pretty fit dude  makes no sound while being killed  don t you think that he might have at least tried to take the killer   br    br   2  when the remark is made that the gym teacher is  soooo in love with lisa   i almost screamed at the screen  when your best friend s family has been killed by a teacher who was in love with her  you don t make comments like that if you have half of a heart  br    br   3  as soon as nash asks the uncle how many exits they have in the house and the uncle catches on that there may be danger ahead  wouldn t the smart thing to do be to get donna  boyfriend  aunt  and uncle into a car and drive far  far away  then bait the house with the hrt and police force so that the killer has no way to get out  br    br   i could go on  and on  and on  basically  the plot was decent  the characters weren t profiled enough for you to actually feel any empathy when they were slaughtered and there were way too many errors  br    br   however  br    br   this movie might be good for teenagers  or young couples just looking for a fun night out  if you don t consider all the goofs  it s a mediocre film ',\n  'why hollywood feels the need to remake movies that were so brilliant their prime  the texas chainsaw massacre  the hills have eyes  but is it considerably worse why hollywood feels the need to remake those horror films that weren t brilliant to start with  prom night  the amityville horror  much like their originals these remakes fail in creating atmosphere  character or any genuine scares at all  prom night is so flat and uninteresting its hard to watch  but for all the wrong reasons  br    br   it s a poorly acted  massively uninteresting and ultimately dull excursion that fails at everything its designed to do  it s clear hollywood horror is dead  even the likes of the hills have eyes and the texas chainsaw massacre managed to ruin their franchises in style with buckets of blood and a decent plot  prom night is virtually bloodless and i m not even going to mention how bad the plot is  its inability to seal the killers identify makes this the least suspenseful horror movie since erm    the original  br    br   one of the most notorious slasher films of the 1980s returns to terrorize filmgoers with this remake that proves just how horrifying high school dances can truly be  donna keppel  brittany snow  has survived a terrible tragedy  but now the time has come to leave the past behind and celebrate her senior prom in style  br    br   when the big night finally arrives  donna and her best friends prepare to enjoy their last big high school blowout by living it up and partying till dawn  but while donna is willing to look past her nightmares and into a brighter future  the man she thought she had escaped forever has returned for one last dance  an obsessed killer is on the loose  and he ll slay anyone who attempts to prevent him from reaching his one and only donna  br    br   who will survive to see graduation day  and what will donna do when she s forced to confront her greatest fear  scott porter  jessica stroup  and dana davis co star in the slasher remake that will have tuxedo clad teens everywhere nervously looking over their shoulders as they file out onto the dance floor  a plot that will probably put you off going to see this  witch if you ask me is a good thing  br    br   without much to work with  mccormick gamely tries to milk tension out of the most banal of situations  at one point  a girl backs into a floor lamp  a lamp   and mccormick tries to pump it up into a jump scare moment  desperate times really do call for desperate measures  there haven t been this many shots of closets since the last ikea catalogue  br    br   in the era of the hills  my super sweet 16 and to catch a predator  there probably is a freaky  scary movie to be mined from the commoditisation of glamour and society s creepy obsession with youthful beauty  this is not that movie  br    br   my final verdict  avoid at all cost  nobody will like prom night  it s even a disappointment to thoses who usually enjoy hack job remakes  considering its absolute lack of blood or frights  a night you ll be in a hurry to forget ',\n  'ok this movie was made for one reason and one reason only to make money  the producers obviously didn t care about killing a classic horror movie  i knew this movie would suck as soon as it was going to be a pg 13 how many pg 13 slashers movies have turned out to be good  thats like asking how many women have been on the moon  the answer is none   prom night 1980 was of cource no masterpiece but it certainly deserves to be recognised as a movie that stays true to its genre and deosnt try to be anything more than that  br    br   my problem with prom night 2008 is the way that it handles the killer and i have 3 major problems with him                      br    br   1 the way he escapes  he was locked up in a mental institute and he escapes through a air conditioning vent   what the hell  why would they have an air conditioning vent in the patients room  do they want him to be comfortable during his stay or something  2 his intentions are somewhat uncertain the killer want all of the main victims family and friends dead so he can have her all to his self  he says he loves her but the next minute he trys to kill her  so does he want to kill her  love her or just plain rape her   3  the killer is too good  how did he develop all of his skills  he used to be a teacher  so in this one scene where he kills the main victims boyfriend while hes basically on top of her asleep and she doesn t notice  it all silly 2 stars out of 10 terrible silly stupid attempt at a horror movie',\n  'the night of the prom  the most important night to any shallow girl composed almost entirely of plastic  and so the characters kept reminding us every ten minutes when some head peckingly miniscule event occurred in their miniscule lives  br    br   there really is no excuse for prom night  there is less than nothing original about it and i truly would have given it zero or less stars were it possible on imdb  the only part of my viewing that i enjoyed was when a group of teenagers sitting in front of us decided to play a game of  ghosts   it was a lot more exciting than whatever was going on on the screen in front of them  br    br   the plot was basically some guy going on a rampage  and the thing was  it wasn t even a slightly exciting rampage  maybe if the guy had been remotely frightening rather than a tame robbie williams lookalike with a baseball cap  i might have sat there feeling slightly anxious  the fact that i cared less about the characters than i did about the colour of the cinema carpet didn t really add to the effect  either  and to make matters worse  the rest of the characters were equally one dimensional and oblivious  the hotel staff didn t seem to notice or care that one of their maids had vanished and are further proof that a murderer is unrecognisable after he has had a shave  i was incredibly surprised that the bitchy  stereotypical girl in the blue dress was the only person to notice who he was  she realises this and then proceeds to fall down the stairs  entangle herself in a plastic sheet and then knock over a pile of paint buckets  nice one  br    br   the worst thing was  i hold the belief that that the director was trying his absolute hardest  he really pushed all boundaries by not showing any killing actually happening  shocking  and the music  don t even get me started  it was almost as appropriate as stripping at a funeral  br    br   i really wish that prom night was a joke  it was terrible and stupidly predictable  no one  in their right mind or otherwise  has any reason to see this film  mainstream cinema seems to be going downhill and films like this worsen the situation  if you get the urge to see this absolutely awful film  hear my plea  don t do it  there are better things to spend six pounds on  like a sheet to play ghosts with ',\n  'the acting was horrendous as well as the screenplay  it was poorly put together and made you almost want to laugh at the several terribly acted out murder scenes  the ending was even worse  everyone kept dying  but somehow the ending made it look like everything was perfectly ok  they did not give enough history about the obsession the teacher had  etc  the movie needed more time to perhaps develop a better storyline  the only reason i give this 3 10 is that i kind of feel bad for the young actors  they needed better coaching  they could have really made this an ok film  but the screenplay and acting failed miserably ',\n  'i saw this film by accident and this movie was an accident   well it must of been  blonde women being stalked the villain appearing then disappearing getting from one place to another in minute s then disappearing and reappearing hiding he was nt even a super hero so i don t know how he did it he could nt frighten a cat and that s not hard to do  br    br   the old  mirror in the bathroom is just not scary anymore in fact it stopped being scary years ago  you had the cop on the trail of the villain another cliché played by idris elba with a very convincing american accent he s from london  the director did nt have a clue and has made a film full of cliché s and make s  scary move which was a comedy look scary  pathetic ',\n  'when i first saw the preview for this movie  i really couldn t wait to see it  the plot seemed good and the setting was great  i mean  a slasher movie that takes place on prom night  great idea   and the plot  a high school teacher that becomes sexually obsessed with one of his students  goes crazy  gets arrested  and escapes three years later on prom night  prom night  a night that is supposed to be happy and memorable  turns into hell   however  i saw it and was extremely disappointed  it was not only the worst  horror movie  i have ever seen  but it was one of the worst movie in general that i have ever seen   first of all  it wasn t even scary  there was not one moment in that movie when i jumped out of my seat  also  the murder scenes were so cheesy and dull  all the slasher did was either stab his victims in the stomach multiple times or cut their throats  also there was absolutely no gore  its rated pg 13   the scene with the most blood was probably the one where the killer murders the black girl  he slits her throat and blood splatters on the sheets hanging around them  they don t actually show him cutting her throat   br    br   next  you see the killers face the first time he is introduced in the movie  he isn t mysterious  creepy  or scary  he s just this guy who kills people  br    br   also  everything in the movie was so cliché  an example is when  at the end  the killer is about to kill the main character and at the last moment  the detective shoots and kills him  also  every single thing in this movie was so predictable  the victim  after seeing the guy with a knife  runs for her life  hides  thinks she gets away  and then the killer just pops out and kills her  br    br   finally  the sequence of the movie was extremely bad  the guy goes into the hotel  kills a few people  the bodies are discovered  someone pulls the fire alarm  and everyone evacuates  the main character forgets something in her room  has an encounter with the killer  runs and escapes  thats it  she and her boyfriend go home  the slasher kills the guards patrolling the house  finds the girl  then gets killed by the detective  the movie sequence was so stupid and cliché  br    br   if your thinking of seeing this movie all because the preview looked good  trust me  don t waste your time or money  no wonder this movie was being shown in the smallest theater in the movie theater  my friend and i  along with these two girls sitting in the back  were the only ones in the theater  that should have told me something about the movie beforehand ',\n  'we have all been asking ourselves  why don t they remake the slasher films that were only ok instead of remaking the ones that were great already  that way they can only make it better   well with prom night they have remade the average but trashy fun 80s jamie lee curtis film and made it even worse  its a paint by numbers slasher film which is clearly trying to attract the young teens  hence no violence etc   the knife in this slasher flick is blunt the director spends so much time focusing on trying to make the rather attractive killer look somewhat creepy that anything else goes out of the window the cast who include britney snow  who was superb in hairspray  try their hardest but the material gives them nothing to do but pout and look scared more annoying is how the death scenes are handled  we will hear the attack but wont see it   it also looks like the only place the knife in this film worked was in the editing suite since the film looks like it has been butchered  im guessing anything remotely scary ended up on the cutting room floor so as not to scare the kids  yet in pours the money from americans sending this film to number 1 at the box office    slasher movies are a lot of fun but in prom nights case it made me want to download the original i ve seen scarier oc and dawsons creek episodes',\n  'i m a big fan of the tv series largo winch  this movie was pain for me  i had to use fast forward not to fell to sleep  it was boring  how can somebody ruin this title so much  the story was the only good thing  actors were sh t  they can t live the role  the main actor tom       is a null  watch the other roles of this actor  the fighting scenes were unbelievable boring and not to followable somehow they were not to follow the situation  like other reviewer said low budget film with bad actors maybe next time somebody else can do better thing out of this title  french can t do right thing with big films like alien 4  that was bit brrr  after alien 1 2 3 ',\n  'first of all  if you r a fan of the comic  well  you ll be very disappointed i m sure   low budget movie     largo is supposed to be serbian in the comic  now suddenly he becomes croatian  pfff  chicken producers  it gave some spice and guts to the comic   by the way  in the film  his father speaks serbian and he speaks croatian    lol    the striking n y  winch building becomes a common average small yacht in h k  the good looking largo becomes some unshaved tzigan turkish looking guy  freddy the cool  scarface  pilot becomes some fat  out of shape  sad  average guy  simon  largo s good buddy  does not exist at all    he gave some pepper   largo doesn t throw knifes at all  but just some snake stares    the whole story is confused and looks like a pretentious tv film  french directors and producers  if you don t have the money  the ability or the technology to adapt correctly the comic  please stick to some romance shooted in paris  very very bad film  good thing i just rented it  don t count on me to watch the sequel   if there is any     ',\n  'in my knowledge  largo winch was a famous belgium comics  never read  telling the adventures of a playboy  a sort of james bond without the spy life  so  when i had to choose a movie for a 5 years old kid  i picked it up because the kid was already a great fan of james bond  br    br   but  just after the opening credits  i got heavy doubts  when american movies offer amazing start  here  no action and a torrid sex scene \\x85 then  the story get very complicated with financial moves\\x85 i thought i lost the kid  br    br   but  strangely  he had been caught by largo  and more than james bond   br    br   was it the excellent interpretation of tomer sisley  the difficult relationship largo has with his father  the multiple box story in which the friends are the bad guys  the bad guys are the friends  the exotic locations of honk kong  yougoslavia   br    br   dunno  but he really cares about largo   will he get up   and we enjoyed our moment ',\n  'chilly  alienating adaptation of rebecca west s book about an army captain returning from duty in wwii with his memory impaired  now there s an original idea    it seems he remembers old flame glenda jackson but not current wife julie christie  which should be enough to set off some emotional sparks  this extremely well cast soaper brings together leading man alan bates with director alan bridges and co stars jackson  christie  ann margret  and ian holm  but the burners are all on low  there are a handful of good scenes  particularly whenever jackson is on screen   but bridges  pacing is unrelievedly sluggish and the film s dulled out color is enervating  long on the shelf

lifetime  the music is genuinely pretty  and the story deserves to be called  classic   what fails in this movie are the characters  particularly the title character  who could only be called  the heroine  in the loosest sense of the term  br    br   after a brief prologue  the audience is introduced to cinderella  she is waking up in the morning and singing  a dream is a wish your heart makes   this establishes her as an idealist  and thus deserving of our sympathy   unfortunately  the script gives us no clue as to what she is dreaming about  freedom from her servant role  the respect of her step family  someone to talk to besides mice and birds  in one song  cut from the movie but presented in the special features section of the latest dvd  cinderella relates her wish that there could be many of her so she could do her work more efficiently  you go girlfriend  in short  cinderella is a very bland character  she passively accepts her step family s abuse  escaping into her unspoken dreams for relief  she only asserts herself once by reminding her stepmother that she is still a member of the family  for this  she is given permission to go the ball if she completes her housework and finds something to wear  a token gesture that is clearly absurd to everyone except  of course  cinderella  can anyone see belle or jasmine being such a doormat  if cinderella is dull  her male counterpart is nothing short of lifeless  the prince in cinderella gets no dialog and almost no screen time  we are given no indication if he is a good man  if he respects cinderella or anything  all we know is 1  he is a prince and 2  he dances well  heck  even the prince from  snow white  got to sing a romantic song at least  not only does this lack of development make the romance less interesting  it makes cinderella look like either a social climber or an idiot  weakening her already tenuous appeal  br    br   perhaps realizing how dull the main characters were  the animators chose to give excessive screen time to the movie s comic relief  cinderella s friends  the mice  granted  these characters are amusing  even so  when the comic relief steals the show from the principals  well  let s just say your story has some problems  br    br   dinsey loves to proclaim all its animated features as  masterpieces   while many of them are  there are some that do not deserve this appellate in any way  cinderella is a prime example of this fact ',\n  'just saw it yesterday in the sao paulo intl film festival  just before going i came here to see how it was rated  and at that time it was 7 4  a pretty nice rate    br    br   after 15 minutes i was dying to get out  never did this   but felt embarrassed to do so as the producer of the movie was in the screening  br    br   i did not like at all  the dialogs are shallow and lead nowhere  the characters are shallower than the dialogs  nothing lead anywhere  and the worst and worst  plenty of siemens and organics advertising on the movie  despite the fact that i already paid to go to the movie and entertain myself  i still have to be bombarded by the main character chatting on the internet and siemens mobile popping up all the time on her lap top  or another character having a bath or cutting her hair just to have organics shampoo displayed enormously on the screen  all of this would be bearable if the plot  characters  romances  anything was good  but was bad  really bad  a  don t know how to do  sex in the city  br    br   don t waste your time or money ',\n  'when i bought this dvd i though   it seems to be a nice light comedy about love and relationships made up in portuguese standards\\x85 let s give it a chance\\x85  i was totally wrong  what a disappointing movie  first  it s not a comedy  it s a cheap drama which can be so melodramatic that it s even worse than many portuguese soap operas  second  the plot is so boring  and leads nowhere\\x85 it has no structure  it just flows  like the wind  in one or another direction\\x85 the production is also bad  the sound mixing is horrible  because sometimes the voices are disconnected  it made me remind some old portuguese movies from the 80 s\\x85 the acting should have been better too\\x85 well  to sum up  it s not with films like this one that portuguese cinema will improve  in fact  it was one of the worst portuguese movies i have seen in the last years  bad argument  bad acting  bad production\\x85 i had no high hopes for this movie  but it was much worse than i ve ever imagined  just forget about it ',\n  ' i ll indicate in this review the point where spoilers begin   my dissatisfaction is split  30  tone deafness  70  lackluster writing  br    br   the 30   i agree with the first commenter s synopsis about the lack of diversity in the characters and scope of the stories  i was surprised how  this film  at best  woefully shortchanges the real nyc by presenting a collection of people and relationships so narrow as to come across as if it s inhabited only by the cast of gossip girl  this is coming from someone who likes gossip girl   a few minority characters are written into the stories  but they are included by obligation  while we can see the gears under the film so clearly  striving to  be diverse  but falling ever so short  br    br   the 70  is why everything falls short  all characters  white plus a few token minorities  are one dimensional  cardboard cutouts of people concepts  worse  their interactions with each other are scripted in such a way that for each vignette in the film the audience is treated to what i d say is a  gag   we get a basic conceit  then some punchline intended to be a clever twist  but even if we suspended cynicism for a moment to say   okay  that was a surprise    the stories are still not that interesting  because they  too  are shallow  when you fashion stories so that their existence hinges solely on the unexpectedness of the ending  you re writing jokes  br    br   spoilers below    br    br   the movie primarily tries to tell romantic stories  that s fine  but romance is amazing  deep  sometimes complex  these  romantic  stories each feature a girl and a boy who at some point share the same location and get to look at each other  words exchange  thoughts are projected through voice over  but they too only manage to communicate to the audience merely that one person is attracted to another  br    br   meaning  there is no seduction  in the broad sense   no tension  and neither confrontation nor communion between the wills of two different people trying to reconcile their existence to accommodate the other  the only story involving a superficial  seduction  is told just so the audience ends up being surprised that the guy  ethan hawke  gets outwitted by the girl he s hitting on  who unexpectedly turns out to be a hooker  sure  his words when trying to pick her up are interesting to hear and we are amused as we d be if we were next to them  but there is nothing of substance to this story outside of  a then b   so it unfolds  if something like a postcard could  unfold   with all the other tales as well  a then b  that s it  the only point being that these happen to occur  on set  in manhattan  by the way  the only brooklyn we see is the coney island sketch  the only queens is the flickering of a train ride taken by a character traveling to the west village  br    br   it s easy to pick at movies that play into all the common stereotypes of race  gender  sexual orientation  and so on   new york  i love you   however  deserves to be held to stricter scrutiny because of its title  we expect to see the real new york  and real new yorkers  but instead we have paraded before us the selected slice of a demographic  its characters flown in from the o c   plus a few others to make it seem as if we are paying attention to diversity  but when we look closer at who those characters are  the whole sham becomes an affront to the very notion of diversity and the ethnicities and cultures the movie shamefully fails to represent  br    br   for example  the story with the latino man with the little white girl in the park  who gets mistaken by two ladies as her manny  male nanny  when in fact he s the father  notwithstanding the last scene of this part was unnecessary from a dramatic construction point of view  it would have been far more interesting to end it when the mother and boyfriend stepfather are strutting the girl away   it is frankly a bit disgusting that the scene where we learn for sure that the girl s father is latino also must inform us that he is a sexually desirable dancer  what  the dad can t be just some guy from south america  now that he s obviously hot  is the audience better prepared to accept that he had a kid with a middle to upper class white woman  are we that naive as to require such  as if a mexican construction worker would obviously be too unpalatable  br    br   it s not my place to dictate where the movie should have gone  but in every conceivable set up and plot twist  the direction taken screams status quo  appeals to safety  all these stories could have been made more interesting  even if we were forced to keep the single dimensionality of the characters inhabiting them  at the very least by not choosing from standard and obvious stereotypes  asian girl living in chinatown being leered at by a scraggly old white guy  how  bout an asian cougar pursuing a white college kid instead  again  i m not saying the entire conceit has to be changed  it s just that every  damn  story premise  is so hackneyed  and thus they fail to convey anything about why one might love new york  outside the trite  the real way to have improved the film would be to have written a script worth reading  br    br   i will concede the pleasantness of the soundtrack  the good pacing of the movie  even if what was being paced was  well  dredge   and the general feel of many of the scenes  the movie was just fine to sit through  and i wouldn t dissuade anyone from doing so  however  it is telling that the most significant homage paid to non superficiality is when the old opera singer says  paraphrased   that s what i love about new york  everyone s from a different place   well  you wouldn t know it from watching this one ',\n  'having loved  paris  je t aime   i highly anticipated this film and i admit i went in with high expectations  but was sorely disappointed for a number of reasons  br    br   although  i was not expecting a re make of  paris  in new york i was expecting the same structure  what i liked about  paris  was the breakup of the neighborhoods  you got a sense of each directors style and the story they wanted to tell  in  ny   there is no clear separation of the stories  at different points in the film  characters from different stories run into each other which made me confused as to who i was watching and what exactly was going on  also  the switch in directing was evident but confusing since there was no flow  br    br   another thing i loved about the  paris  film was the different takes on love  it wasn t all romantic  there was love between parents and their children  unrequited love  a lonely  middle aged woman yearning for love etc   it explored so many layers of the complexity of love between humans   ny  seemed to only go for an edgy  over the top sexuality  there were some redeemable shorts  the older couple having spent a lifetime together  julie christie s short   but overall the ny  film didn t evoke any emotion for me  i didn t connect with any of the characters like i did with  paris   i remember watching  paris  and feeling a deep sadness  loneliness  yearning  hopefulness  wonder    it just had so much soul  for me  there was no soul in the  ny  film  br    br   maybe if i had gone into it without having  paris  looming in the back of my brain as a comparison this film might have elicited a more favorable response  but as a self titled re take of  paris  je t aime  i was sorely disappointed ',\n  'i saw this regurgitated pile of vignettes tonight at a preview screening and i was straight up blown away by how bad it was   br    br   first off  the film practically flaunted its gaping blind spots  there are no black or gay new yorkers in love  or who  say  know the self involved white people in love  i know it s not the love crash of anvil tastic inclusiveness but you can t pretend to have a cinematic new york with out these fairly prevalent members of society  plus  you know the people who produced this ish thought crash deserved that ham handed oscar  so where is everyone   br    br   possibly worse than the bizarre and willful socioeconomic ignorance were the down right offensive chapters  remember when you were in high school and people were openly disgusted with pretty young women in wheelchairs  me either   this movie ran the gamut of ways to be the worst  bad acting  bad writing  bad directing    all spanning every possible genre ever to concern wealthy white people who smoke cigarettes outside fancy restaurants   br    br   but thank god they finally got powerhouses hayden christensen and rachel bilson back together for that jumper reunion  and  side note  uma dodged a bullet  ethan hawke looks ravaged  this  of course  is one thing in terms of his looks  but added an incredibly creepy extra vibe of horribleness to his terrifyingly scripted scene opposite poor  lovely maggie q  br    br   i had a terrible time choosing my least favorite scene for the end of film questionnaire  but it has to be the anton yelchin  olivia thirlby bit for the sheer lack of taste  which saddens me because i really like those two actors  i don t consider myself easily offended  but all i could do was scoff and look around with disgust like someone s 50 year old aunt   br    br   a close second place in this incredibly tight contest of terrible things is shia labeouf s tone deaf portrayal of what it means for a former disney channel star to act against julie christie  i don t mean opposite  i mean against  against is the only explanation  i realize now that the early sequence with orlando bloom is a relative highlight  highlight  please keep that in mind when your brain begins to leak out your ear soon after the opening credits  which seem to be a nod to the first new york real world  this film is embarrassing  strangely dated  inarticulate  ineffective  pretentious and  in the end  completely divorced from any real idea of new york at all   br    br    the extra star is for the cloris leachman  eli wallach sequence  as it is actually quite sweet  but it is only one bright spot in what feels like hours of pointless  masturbatory torment  ',\n  'i ve never been to paris  but after seeing  paris  je t aime  i m crazy to visit this city  i ve been to ny several times and i love the city and its boroughs  i kinda expected to be touched by this film  to feel like jumping into a plane and fly there right away  but  lo and behold  i regret the time and money i spent with it  there are no love stories between people or a person and the city  there s a lot of dysfunctional meetings and relations or people who know each other and it just doesn t work out fine  maybe this reflects a characteristic of the city  where it s said to have thousands of people living on their own  can t you find love in new york ',\n  'this was a movie i could not wait to see  so i finally got it and i was pretty disappointed  for starters the movie has so little said about new york just a bunch of confusing shots of buildings streets bridges and cafes it really doesn t stay focused on the new york magic another thing that changed my mind was the french movie set inside this movie i know that it is a remake but it is not a french style remake  anyway here you will notice elements that remind you of french movies such as long and messy scenes no or little talking and of course everyone is smoking french style   the story follows many lives   too many for my taste  and they somehow seem connected in the end  i feel like there was no dedication to the characters as much as there was on the stories  the movie was too short to cover every single destiny everyone s happy ending so we can see about 30 people for about 5 minutes each and there you have your 120 minutes   if you like active scenes dialogues and stuff this is not the movie for you   i give it 4 just because i love new york and i loved the cast  ',\n  'following the success of  paris  je t aime   a group of directors decided to get together and make a similar anthology style film based in new york  unlike the original film  the stories in this film seem to sometimes come and go too quickly  by the time you think are getting into a story  it s over in too many cases  and  the often start up and stop and then begin again  with the stories woven together  as a result  there is no title to indicate that a story is complete and it is less formal in structure  br    br   sadly  however  while  paris  je t aime  was hit or miss  mostly hit   most of  new york  i love you  was miss  the stories tended to be much more sexual in nature but also far less sweet  and often quite terrible  it was an amazingly dull and uninteresting film with only a few exceptional stories  and perhaps the often depressing music made it seem more so  now understand  it was good quality music but its somber tone really  really made me feel like cutting my wrists  among the better ones was the story about the young man who took a girl in a wheelchair to prom  the couple talking about cheating outside a restaurant  though this was also in the first film  and the crotchety old couple  this is all so sad because i had loved the first film so much  and i really wanted to love this film  i respected what they tried but simply didn t like it very much  br    br   by the way  and this is not really a complaint  but i was amazed how many people were smoking in the film  for a recent film  that was unusual in our more anti smoking culture  br    br   also  if you get the dvd  there are two segments included as extras that were not included in the film  one consists of kevin bacon  wearing a cool fedora  eating a hotdog    and absolutely nothing more for almost ten minutes  the other features a teen who spends the film videotaping the world  including a very unhappy couple ',\n  'a few years back the same persons who created paris j taime   which was imperfect but very enjoyable   my rating was a 7   created this piece of garbage about new york city  br    br   in paris  i love you  j taime created a feeling for paris   it was made in many parts of beautiful paris  br    br   in this current film  i did not recognize new york city  i did not feel that i was in the city of my birth  br    br   new york does have 5 boroughs i saw no scenes in the bronx  or queens  there is one scene in brooklyn  brighton beach   i saw no scenes in times square or greenwich village  no scenes of the beautiful hotels or theatres  it does have a large cast most of the performers were not even stereotypes  they were caricatures of the lowest sort  br    br   the very few humorous moments are all of a course sexual nature or quite insulting to the many fine new yorkers that we all know   love    br    br   a few of the films nominated for the  razzie  awards were far better  br    br   ratings     out of 4  20 points  out of 100  imdb 1  out of 10  br    br   in my way of thinking i think the title should have been br    br   new york  i hate you ',\n  'an anthology is always risky business and i think this endeavor should be praised  there s a lot of talent involved here  a great many talented actors  directors and writers  unfortunately  i couldn t really enjoy this movie based on three issues i had  br    br   first of all  the segments vary incredibly in tone and quality  and unfortunately some of them clash with the others   br    br   secondly  several segments feel underdeveloped to me  like seeds of good stories that never come to fruition  i m not talking about happy endings here  or even an ending period  but rather  they lack even basic development or even solid setups that draw you in   br    br   last but not least  i did not feel new york and its inhabitants were properly portrayed  br    br   what you re left with is high brow short films that may still be of interest to some but will leave the average viewer unsatisfied ',\n  'new york  i love you  or rather should be titled manhattan  i love looking at your people in sometimes love  is a precise example of the difference between telling a story and telling a situation  case in point  look at two of the segments in the film  one where ethan hawke lights a cigarette for a woman on a street and proceeds to chat her up with obnoxious sexy talk  and another with orlando bloom trying to score a movie with an incredulous demand from his director to read two dostoyevsky books  while the latter isn t a great story by any stretch  it s at least something that has a beginning  middle and end  as the composer tries to score  gets dostoyevky dumped in his lap  and in the end gets some help  and maybe something more  from a girl he s been talking to as a liaison between him and the director  the ethan hawke scene  however  is like nothing  and feels like it  like a fluke added in or directed by a filmmaker phoning it in  or  for that matter  hawke with a combo of before sunrise and reality bites   br    br   what s irksome about the film overall is seeing the few stories that do work really well go up against the one or two possible  stories  and then the rest of the situations that unfold that are made to connect or overlap with one another  i e  bits involving bradley cooper  drea dematteo  hayden christensen  andy garcia  james caan  natalie portman  etc   it s not even so much that the film  set practically always in  manhattan  and not the new york of queens or staten island or the bronx  not even  say  harlem or washington heights   lacks a good deal of diversity  since there is some  it s the lack of imagination that one found in spades  for better or worse  in paris j taime  it s mostly got little to do with new york  except for passing references  and at its worst  the julie christie shia labeouf segment  it s incomprehensible on a level that is appalling  br    br   so  basically  wait for tv  and do your best to dip in and out of the film   in  that is  for three scenes  the aforementioned bloom christina ricci segment which is charming  the brett ratner directed segment  yes  x men 3 brett ratner  with a very funny story of a teen taking a girl in a wheelchair to the prom only to come upon a great big twist  and eli wallach and cloris leachman as an adorable quite old couple walking along in brooklyn on their 67th wedding anniversary  everything else can be missed  even natalie portman s directorial debut  and the return of a hughes brother  only one  allan  to the screen  a mixed bag is putting it lightly  it s like having to search through a bag of mixed nuts full of crappy peanuts to find the few almonds left ',\n  'the problems with this film are many  but i will try to mention the most glaring and bothersome ones  first of all  while the theme suggests a number of vignettes about manhattan life  the reality was that everything  as usual in movies and tv  was about something bizarre  usually of a sexual nature  the story lines were thin or nonexistent  and virtually every scene  camera shot  line of dialog  and expressed emotion was absolutely  and totally fake  it finally reached a point after an hour of so of mind numbing garbage that i walked out  something no uncommon for me in recent years   i would have guessed the fi9lm was directed by some wannabe auteur drop outs from some 3rd rate film studies program  but i believe the  at one time  pre amelia  talented director mira nair took part in this disgusting travesty  so perhaps the directorial talent in america has descended en masse into the cesspool ',\n  'there is a reason this went straight to video  the story is smarmy  nick cage plays johnny in a sleazy way  sex in churches  and other scenes that border on tasteless like the scene in the laundry room  taint this movie  judge reinhold as the cuckold is okay  but the movie itself with its themes of degradation and revenge are not well done  but it is a good film for trivia contests  because so few people saw it ',\n  'thanks to some infamous home video distributor who brought in the so called

be flying off to london to do something related to his artwork  but the fact is  he is flying off to venice with charlotte for an adultery holiday  eva kidnapped nick and dragged her 2 kids along to venice for confrontation  the trip to venice ends up both nick and eva falling for one another  br    br   the presentation of the journey from germany to venice between nick and eva marks the failure of the comedy  it not only look senseless  but also draggy  in the film  nick try to seek help for several ways  but it ends to no avail  it is either the strangers around him who acts like morons  or they are just simply dumb  br    br   the comedy also had the tendency to add in unnecessary scenes to lengthen the story  while some of the problems that can be solved with common sense  no one in the film are using common sense to solve the problem  they prefer to go through one big round to solve the problem  br    br   it fails so bad  that even the beautiful sceneries in venice fails to

'when i sat down to watch this film i actually expected quite a bit  as the plot takes on quite complex issues  using football as launching pad for the complication also was an interesting approach  still unfortunately  despite its bravery of dealing with controversial issues as culture clashes between muslim and western culture  adding generation conflicts and prejudice towards gays lesbians  it lets you down towards the resolution with a rather simplistic relief to all the suspense built up throughout the film  this leads me to the impression that the makers took on a little too big a task for themselves to tackle  attempting to be more profound then they managed to deal with  br    br   however  this does not mean that the film is directly bad  as it s rendering of the conflicts where quite believable and also amusing  the film succeeds in being engaging and entertaining in this matter  but as mentioned above the writers seem to have spun themselves a little too deep  this has led to some quite unrealistic character behaviour towards the end to confront the surging conflicts  by this dropping the ball at a time where the makers could really have shown brilliance taking the film to another level of appreciation  br    br   even if the film does at no point really attempt to be a profound piece of drama  the setting has so much potential in the plot it becomes a disappointment when  the ball drops   this way the film moves from being a good and reflected comedy to a standard cliché that becomes ridiculous in its happy ending  nothing is left out in the hollywood like ending  so even if the story is engaging and one can stomach the large amount of montages  one can t help but roll eyes towards the resolution  personally i was close to shouting  finish already    at the screen  br    br   there were some decent acting in the film  and the two young female central characters had some good moments  so did their parents and other bi characters  however the handsome irish coach was an embarrassing piece of acting  that lets the film down quite a bit in terms of realism  he didn t even appear very likable  but rather self involved despite his good deeds  which makes the impending conflict between the girls seem a little strained  br    br   i give the film a 4  as it was an engaging story and they sought out a nice perspective to approach the subject from  the script and cast had many good believable characters  giving the audience a chance to recognise either themselves or others  had the let downs not been this disappointing  i d easily give the film a 7 or 8  if you enjoyed this film  i d recommend the film  east is east   which i think is an as good  if not better rendering of cultural conflict  as well as being amusing and engaging ',\n  'long

  and the interpretation of both actors  daniel auteil and pasqal duquenne  was very good  i decided to go on watching the movie  the french cinema  in general  has the ability of showing something

stereotypes  they introduced a russian character for the sole purpose of mocking him and making fun of the way he talked  he was portrayed as being wild  ignorant and amazingly shallow  they were just getting warmed up though for the usual nonsense about gays  gina decides to be gay for a while since she isn t having any luck with guys  honestly  that wasn t that bad except they really went overboard when gina brought a lesbian to a christmas party her friends were throwing  her lesbian date had very short hair  like i m sure all lesbians do   she also got quite upset  like i m sure all

act on stage  it s all downhill from here  unfortunately  reynaud s character is a maneater who eventually kills her lovers in some sort of trance  franco had a decent budget to work with and spends it well on nice locations  beautiful photography and a mesmerizing musical score  this could have been his greatest film indeed  if it wasn t for the lame and uninteresting story  it s supposed to be

succubus is unfortunately is a truly awful film  i ve got to admit that i saw the american cut version  which runs at about 76 minutes  but unless it was just the logic that was cut  i m sure the longer european version is just as boring  the plot has something to do with a woman marauding around  practicing s m and talking rubbish  and it s all really boring  there s no gore and the sex is dull  and most of the runtime is taken up by boring dialogue and despite the fact that this is a short film  i had difficulty making it all the way to the end  i have to say that the locations look good and franco has done a good job of using his surreal atmosphere  but the positive elements end there  jess franco is definitely a talented director that has made some classic trash films   but this looks like it was one he made for the money  and overall i recommend skipping it and seeing some of the director s more interesting works ',\n  ' succubus   the edited version of  necronomicon

cultists say stanley kubrick took a great horror tale and ruined it  the kubrick cultists don t give a damn about king s story  they talk about steadicams  tracking shots  camera angles this is a film  they insist  it should be considered on its own  as it happens  both camps are correct  unfortunately  br    br   if one views it purely as an adaptation of king s novel   the shining  is indeed a failure  a wasted opportunity  a series of botched narrative gambits   br    br   i used to blame that on kubrick s screenwriter  the writer diane johnson  author of le marriage  l affaire  le divorce  etc   has a reputation as an novelist of social manners  maybe she was chosen for her subtle grasp of conjugal relations or family dynamics  but the little blue collar town of sidewinder  colorado doesn t exist on any map in her francophile universe   br    br   kubrick the anglophile probably found her congenial  however  he  of course  is the real auteur  and considered on its own merits  his screenplay for  the shining     with its mishmash of abnormal psychology  rationalism  supernaturalism  and implied reincarnation    just doesn t stand up to logical analysis  br    br   i m willing to consider kubrick s  shining  on its own terms  i m even willing to take it as something other than a conventional horror genre movie  but it doesn t succeed as a naturalistic study of isolation  alienation  and madness either  parsed either way  the film pretty much falls apart  br    br   are the horrors of the overlook hotel real  or do they exist only in the mind    first as prescient nightmares suffered by little danny torrance  then as the hallucinations of his father  one notes how whenever jack torrance is seen talking to a  ghost  he is in fact looking into a mirror  one notes how the hotel s frozen topiary hedge maze appears to symbolize jack s stunted  convoluted psyche  very deep stuff  br    br   but if indeed the overlook s  ghosts  are purely manifestations of jack torrance s growing insanity  then who exactly lets the trapped jack out of the hotel kitchen s dead bolted walk  in closet  so that he can go on his climactic ax wielding rampage  br    br   and can anyone explain  with a straight face  that black and white photograph  helpfully labelled  1921   of nicholson as a tuxedoed party goer that pops up out of left field and onto a hotel ballroom wall during the film s closing seconds  are we to seriously conclude that jack torrance s bad craziness stems from a some sort of  past life  experience   and if you swallow that  since when are reincarnated people supposed to be exact physical replicas their past selves   br    br   maybe kubrick didn t care about his storyline  maybe only wanted to evoke a mood of horror  whatever the case  the film tries to hedge its narrative bets    to have it both ways  rational and supernatural  as a result  the story is a mess  this movie hasn t improved with age  and it certainly doesn t improve with repeated viewings  br    br   i don t deny that a few moments of fear  claustrophobia  and general creepiness are scattered throughout this long  long film  but those gushing elevators o  blood  seen repeatedly in little danny s visions  are absurd and laughable  and jack torrance s infamous tag lines   wendy  i m home   and  heeeeeere s johnny    merely puncture the movie s dramatic tension and dissipate its narrative energy   i know  i sat in the theater and heard the audience laugh in comic relief   whew  glad we don t have to take this stuff seriously    finally  kubrick is completely at sea    or else utterly cynical    during those scenes in which wendy wanders around the empty hotel while her husband tries to puree their son  a foyer full of mummified guests  all sitting there dead in their party hats  yikes  now i really am afraid  br    br   given jack nicholson s brilliance over the years  one can only assume that he gave just the sort of eyeball rolling  eyebrow wiggling  scenery chomping performance that the director wanted  the performance of shelley duvall  as a sort of female version of don knotts in  the ghost and mr  chicken   is best passed over in silence  br    br   this movie simply doesn t succeed    not as an adaptation  not on its own terms  it probably merits a 3 out of 10  but i m giving it a 1 because it has been so grotesquely over rated in this forum ',\n  'i caught this stink bomb of a movie recently on a cable channel  and was reminded of how terrible i thought it was in 1980 when first released  many reviewers out there aren t old enough to remember the enormous hype that surrounded this movie and the struggle between stanley kubrick and steven king  the enormously popular novel had legions of fans eager to see a supposed  master  director put this multi layered supernatural story on the screen   salem s lot  had already been ruined in the late 1970s as a tv mini series  directed by tobe hooper  he of  texas chainsaw massacre  fame  and was badly handled  turning the major villain of the book into a  chiller theatre  vampire with no real menace at all thus destroying the entire premise  fans hoped that a director of kubrick s stature would succeed where hooper had failed  it didn t happen  br    br   sure  this movie looks great and has a terrific opening sequence but after those few accomplishments  it s all downhill  jack nicholson cannot be anything but jack nicholson  he s always crazy and didn t bring anything to his role here  i don t care that many reviewers here think he s all that in this clinker  the  here s johnny   bit notwithstanding   he s just awful in this movie  so is everyone else  for that matter  scatman crothers  character  dick halloran  was essential to the plot of the book  yet kubrick kills him off in one of the lamest  shock  sequences ever put on film  i remember the audience in the theater i saw this at booing repeatedly during the last 45 minutes of this wretched flick  those that stayed that is   many left  king s books really never translate well to film since so much of the narratives occur internally to his characters  and often metaphysically  kubrick jettisoned the tension between the living and the dead in favor of style here and the resulting mess ends so far from the original material that we ultimately don t really care what happens to whom  br    br   this movie still stinks and why so many think it s a horror masterpiece is beyond me ',\n  'i hate this movie  it was nothing like the book  and just thinking about it makes me mad  if you watch the movie before reading the book  then yeah  it s a good movie  but king s book was amazing and this movie was nothing like it  i mean  the general meaning might be sort of similar but most aspects of the movie are completely different  the ending for example  so in the book it is extremely intense and danny and wendy escape seconds before the hotel explodes  but in this horrible movie version jack like takes them through a stupid maze    yeah  there is no maze in the book and there is no reason for it  another part that made me angry was that jack just kills mr  halloran  what the heck  he is basically the hero of the book and they just kill him off like he wasn t important  overall  it was just bad that the movie was so extremely off ',\n  'many king fans hate this because it departed from the book  but film is a different medium and books should change when they make the jump  that notwithstanding  the movie does fail completely  but it fails entirely on film terms  i d like to smack the people who tell me it s the scariest movie ever made  i always follow up with the question  really    exactly what scene scared you   every fan i ve asked  goes silent  occasionally someone  at a loss for a decent scare  there are none      names the  grape juice shooting out of elevators  shtick  if you re afraid of that  i don t know what to tell you  except maybe that you re easily scared  i just rolled my eyes watching these z grade horror ideas play out in this schlocky  incoherent movie  br    br   one place it diverts from the book and really is insipid is the tedious work the movie does to get mr halloran up to the overlook only to kill him  with the dumbest member of the audience knowing that jack is waiting behind one of the columns in the corridor that it takes halloran forever to walk down  really one of the stupidest sequences ever put on film   br    br   oh  and nice choice for mr  halloran s artwork stanley  black light afro nymphomaniacs really add to the mood and character development of a horror movie  has there ever been a more  off   out of place shot in any movie ever made  br    br   i consider it a miracle that i was eventually able to bypass this turd  and agree that kubricks 2001 is a truly important film  given the immense  bad will  generated by both this stupid  stupid movie  and the cult of fawning but inarticulate kubrick fan boys  who couldn t describe an idea at work in it with every film resource in the library of congress in front of them   br    br   toss in the grotesque overacting of jack nicholson  the introduction of dumb one liners at tense moments  and the razzie nominated performance of shelly duvall and you have a very crappy movie ',\n  'these writings write about the end of the plot so don t read it if you haven t seen this rubbish  br    br   i found this rubbish film in the horror section which made me think it would be a horror  if i owned a video store i d put it in the boring section  this film is so rubbish it will make you feel like you have lost your socks  br    br   this film contains endless shots of people driving as if that was scary  well i drive to work and back  and sometimes to the store or to visit my cats  almost every day and trust me it s not scary  it even starts with 20 minutes of some people driving  even the little kid does it too  round and round he goes and he never stops  what s so scary about watching a little kid riding a bicycle for an hour  i think nothing and if you watch it you will not think so too  br    br   the family in the car arrive at a big castle and they are given a tour just walking around endlessly looking at kitchens  then the man walks around a for an hour and tries to kill his family for no reason  that s all that happens and as you can see it s rubbish ',\n  'not the best of the films to be watched nowadays  i read a lot of reviews about shining and was expecting it to be very good  but this movie disappointed me  the sound and environment was good  but there was no story here  not was there a single moment of fright  i expected it to a horror thriller movie  but there was no horror no thriller  the only scene where i got scared was during the chapter change scene showing  wednesday   there are lots of fragments i the movie  most of the things are left unexplained with nothing to link it to anything  the story does not tell us about the women or other scenes that is shown  might be a good movie to watch in the 80 s  but not for the 21st century ',\n  'ladies and gentlemen please don t get fooled by  a stanley kubrick  film tag this is a very bad film which unfortunately has been hailed as one of the deadliest horror films ever made horror films should create such a fear that during nights people should shiver their hearts out while thinking about a true horror film in shining there is no real horror at all but what we find instead is just a naive foolish attempt made to create chilling horror everyone knows as to how good the attempts are if they are different from reality all that is good in the film is the view of the icy valley  the hotel where most of the actors were lodged appears good too a word about the actors jack nicholson looks like a lost lazy soul who is never really sure of what he is supposed to do there is not much to be said of a bald colored actor who for the most of times is busy pampering a kid actor no need to blame the bad weather for the tragedy it cannot be avoided as the film has been made and poor kubrick is not alive to make any changes ',\n  'ok  honestly i dont see why everybody thinks this is so great  its really not  there were two good things that came out of this movie 1  jack s performance  he was very good i can tip my hat for him  2  danny s performance  he was good  no other then that it got pretty stupid  and  what was stanley kubrick thinking drafting shelly as the wendy  she was so bad  she looked the same every time she got scared  the problem with this movie was the ending  i would have had more respect for it if kubrick would have ended it differently  and  the over all movie was just stupid  the problem with the movie is that the book was so much better  so dont see the movie read the book and you will be much better off  3 10 ',\n  'i am going to keep this short this  adaption  of the wonderful king book is a bad joke and nothing more of course there are many kubrick and nickolson fans in this site and as a result this movie has mysteriously find its way in the top 250  br    br   jack nicholson is laughable as torrance and so is shelley duvall the story that has nothing to do with the book is an incoherent mess and the characters of jack and wendy torrance are complete jokes  br    br   my advice to anyone that hasn t read the book and wants to understand the characters of this story stick to the tv series      br    br   oh  and the people who are saying that kubrick had every right to destroy the king story cause king is   not a good writer should stick to reviewing  masterpieces  like  eyes wide shut  ',\n  'after just finishing the book the same day i watched the movie  i knew what was supposed to happen  i had high expectations of the movie  because of the rating  the only reason i give this movie a 2 out of 10 stars is that it was alright trying to be a movie  i have a couple main points for not liking this movie  br    br              spoilers            br    br   1  the casting  jack nicholson barely fits into jack torrence s character  also  i would have never picked shelly duvall for wendy  i pictured wendy much differently  i can see why they picked jack nicholson though  the grin  the pointy eyebrows  but he s not supposed to really look  evil   he s supposed to look normal  and he turns evil  also  they make one of the worst movie couples  danny was alright  he needed more life though  he acted way to droney  br    br   2  the screenplay  they cut out so many things that were in the book  and added things  some of the things that were in the book that i was looking forward to in the movie were either deleted  changed  or handled wrongly  some of the things that were in the book that i was looking forward to seeing  the hedge animals  the roque mallet  the elevator  were not in the movie  and it was 2 and half hours   i was extremely irritated  br    br   3  the ending  the ending was changed completly  halorann died  jack froze to death  wendy never got hurt   the overlook didn t blow up  the ending was so cool in the book  and the movie messed it up so horribly  i was apalled  hallorann was never supposed to die  but jack killed him with an ax  if they wanted to kill him  at least have jack use a roque mallet  you never even saw a roque mallet during the whole movie  br    br   there are other things that i didn t like about the movie  but there are things that were all right  the camera angels were cool  the blood coming out of the elevator  didn t happen in the book  was cool  but maybe i was too irritated that the movie didn t go with the book  to try to be scared at all  i reccomend reading the book  before you see this movie  i applaud stephen king for actually agreeing to sign a contract to not dis stanley kubrik any more  i would never have done that  i would have taken all the rights i could get to yell at him all day  i can t wait to see the 6 hour version  at least it has the hedge animals  br    br   rating  2 10',\n  'this has got to be the most stupid film i have ever seen  spoilers ahead   first of all  the plot is stupid  the little kid is weird and they move to a hotel because his father is the caretaker of it  we find that the kid has a gift  the  shining   this gift never ever has anything to do with anything except to make the kid seem cool  then the movie gets more boring and boring until the man finally goes crazy  he goes on a rampage to kill the kid and his wife because    well  he feels like it  why else would he do it  all of a sudden we see a naked woman in the tub  the man kisses her and realizes he is kissing a dead corpse  which is utterly disgusting  somehow a black man enters the hotel and is whacked with an axe  then the kid and the woman take the black man s vehicle and leave the father  who dies within minutes of hypothermia  most movies aren t a complete waste of time  but this falls right into that category  the music is trashy  the characters are corny  except jack nicholson  who is a good actor   the plot is twisted and fits the description of vomit  the ending is very predictable  the storyline is slow  tedious  and boring  this movie is extremely overrated  avoid this movie at all costs  i m surprised it s gotten such a high rating on imdb ',\n  'one star  that s all this documentary deserves  i haven t felt this disappointed in watching a movie  let alone a documentary  in quite some time  br    br   i m a big fan of the  walking with     series  including it s nigel marvin spin offs  for all their gleeful fun yet informative information  and although the subject of prehistoric man has never interested me nearly as much as other prehistoric creatures  the subject is still interesting and unique to explore  having seen all the other docs from the series  i figured i need to see this one as well  especially after seeing relatively good reviews in other places  br    br   well for those of you who put up a good review of this doc    what were you thinking   lol  br    br   though the information that they were able to get through was interesting  the presentation failed in every other way possible  it had a terrible flow  was incredibly unfocused in what it was trying to say  with information scrambled and sometimes out of of place   horrible effects  that includes the few moments of cgi and especially the makeup effects   and overused mtv style camera effects  br    br   speaking of the makeup effects  one reviewer here mentioned how laughable the scene was when the cavemen come across this giant ape and how it looks a lot like a 70s man in suit horror movie  well there are plenty of moments just like that were the people portraying the ape men looked ridiculous and acted ridiculous  none of this is helped by horrible camera positions and compositions  br    br   the worst part of all is none of it is shown in an interesting or dynamic way  or looks remotely real  it doesn t even look like it was taken seriously  it also lacked any emotional punch that the predecessors of the series had  remember the episode in  walking with dinosaurs  of the fate of the ornithochirus  sp    that episode still gets me on the verge of tears every time i watch it  it s this sort of engagement with the subject that lacks here most of all  when you are more engaged in the subject and it s own personal story  even one that is just speculation  you care more about the facts surrounding it  br    br   the only saving graces of this production are the fairly good narration  at least in the bbc version i saw  and the music  otherwise  do not bother even renting this one unless you want to have a good laugh  which i did frequently  but usually followed by rolling eyes   this does not belong on the shelf with the other  walking with     docs  br    br   and does it make sense to learn that this doc was not produced or directly involved with the same people who did the others in the series  hmmm   ',\n  'ok  if you re looking for another bastketball diaries  this is completely the wrong film  br    br   i revolves around two brothers  max  the younger  has a major cocaine addiction  adam  the eldest  is a doctor  this movie is suppose to show the plunge from reality to the extreme lows that drugs make possible  it however  does not  it shows that cocaine can be fun no matter what the situation happens to be present  most of the movie focus is on max and his parting ways  eventually adam  can no longer take the stress from his job and begins to use as well  perscription drugs   br    br   this movie has almost no climax  doesn t descend into what cocaine really does to you  has boring and low budget scenes  and the acting of the eldest brother  adam  is horrific  br    br   i have no idea how this movie has managed to pass and receive awards  it is not a heart wencher  if you want a clear and true story movie on the extreme world of drugs  rent  if not buy  the basketball diaries   and notice the difference  br    br   try to avoid this movie but  if you think you will enjoy  try and see for yourself   ',\n  'the movie is about two brothers that are supposed to be alike   but are not in any way expect for being smart   one is a surgeon and they other is able to write a computer code  geniuses as they like to call themselves which sounds very exaggerated if you compare it to personal characteristics can you perceive from the material of the title  br    br   i honestly didn t like the style of the movie  i believe that anxiety  confusion and deep blues it brings are there for a purpose  but what i don t get is why there is so much of it  the movie is cheap on scenes and tells the story basically with no human aspect in it at all  it gives the comic book like experience  however it s visually numbing the viewer  it somehow brings him inside the blues with brief dialogs  monotonic scenes  dynamic cut  music and abrupt noises  br    br   the movie s storyline is very simple  most of what s going on is being dramatically pictured for long minutes  mostly in confusing delirium simulating effects of drug use and dynamic cuts  br    br   i will say openly that this movie didn t meet my expetations a tiny bit ',\n  'this has to be  by far  the absolute worst movie i have seen in the last 20 years  when i saw that michael madsen was in it i figured it couldn t be too bad a movie since he has been in some pretty decent films  and he was a pretty fair actor  wrong  no one should waste their time on this film  i fast forwarded through 80 percent of it and i don t feel that i missed a thing ',\n  'it is a pity that you cannot vote zero stars on imdb  because i would not have hesitated  in fact i would go so far as to say that this film was in the negative stars   br    br   i  like many others  bought this film thinking that because it has michael madsen in it  it could be good    no chance  this film was shocking  imagine a movie length  the bold and the beautiful   well  primal instinct did not even come close to that good  and i had previously thought that there would be nothing worse than a movie length  the bold and the beautiful    br    br   michael madsen  how could you do this to us  the worst part is  i didn t fast forward a bit  i was hoping that at the end they would reveal that it was all some sort of sick joke  that they thought it would be funny to make us watch such a horribly bad film  br    br   where do i start     directing   zero stars  screenplay   zero stars  acting   zero stars  cinematography   zero stars  digital effects   zero stars  production design   zero stars  make up   zero stars  casting   zero stars  editing   zero stars  trailer   half a star  graphic design   half a star  dvd menu   half a star  br    br   however i think that it is very important to have seen bad films just so that you know what a really bad film is  so for that reason i am happy that i saw this film  just so that i have a bad film to put at the bottom of my list ',\n  'this has to be the worst movie i have seen  madsen fans don t be drawn into this like i was  he is only in it for a maximum of five minutes  this movie is so bad that the only reason why you would watch it is if all the rest

ridiculous and silly  the original lion king was a masterpiece  it had a serious story with light comedy thrown in  this one was just silly and made a mockery of it  i swear  sometimes timon and pumbaa are just way too overplayed  they re overplayed to the point of no longer being funny  just annoying  the original voice cast is back  nathan lane as timon  ernie sabella as pumbaa  matthew broddrick as adult simba  whoopi goldberg as shenzi  cheech marin as bonzai  jim cummings as ed  robert guillame as rafiki  new to the cast are julie kavner of tv s  too  long running series the simpsons as timon s mom and jerry stiller as uncle max  so anyway  this movie isn t the lion king iii  and it isn t ii because there already is a ii  it takes place right after part i and part ii is a ways away  hence  it s 1 1 2  in conclusion  i don t recommend this to die hard lion king fans because it s far too ridiculous and frivilous  however the kids will love it so i recommend it to them  i hope this will also be the last lion king movie  two is enough   the lion king 1 1 2   what we ve come to expect from disney sequel makers  br    br    ',\n  'i saw and liked the first two a lot  really  especially because the second is not just a try to make another one as good as the first  and it s a story standing alone  you don t have to know the first movie  i liked that in the  free willy  movies  too  br    br   but    the third  here is absolutely useless  i tried it with a friend of mine  because we both liked the first two  we decided to stop after a good half an hour  the movie is okay  there are funny parts in it alright  but what for  timon and pumba were funny creatures in the first two movies  what lion king 1 1 2 is for me is  a hard attempt to get even more fun of the first movie than it had already  plus telling the story from their point of view  but what for  i d really like to know  you know  the idea of the two of them sitting in the cinema watching the first one  is really nice  but what comes after is mostly unnecessary  i guess many people liked timon and pumba  and so do i really  yet  for me many parts were very constructed with a try to be funny  no chance  most of it wasn t funny at all  at least for me  btw  what was the movie about anyway  was it a  about timon and pumba or b  an attempt to get more fun out of the first movie  i tend to choose option b and i m very disappointed about it  br    br   if you like to see stories like   the story behind xy   you should see  rosencrantz and guildenstern are dead  by tom stoppard with tim roth and gary oldman  that s really funny and no try to get more out of  hamlet  then it has ',\n  'a dedicated fan to the tlk movies  with the first one being a milestone and the second probably the best sequel disney has produced  along comes this film    now i m not arguing with animation  voice work  music  but this is no more than a timon pumbaa screwloose in the tlk atmosphere  although it isn t bad  it doesn t add anything  basically this movie is one big joke    and that s about all that saves it  make a real tlk3  disney  the potential is there  br    br   4 10',\n  'having watched both the lion king and lion king ii and enjoyed both thoroughly  i thought lion king 1 5 might be worth watching  what a disappointment   disney must be getting desperate for revenues  br    br   especially now that they lost the deal with pixar  br    br   basically  they just picked up some bits of footage that were left on the editor s floor  or garbage can  and glued them together to make a br    br   quick buck  unlike lk i   ii  both of which had strong story lines  br    br   this movie hardly has a story at all  while the characters and animation are always fun to look at  there is simply not enough material here for a movie  some of the bits could have been good 2nd disk fillers on the original offerings  br    br   disney   shame on you for putting this trash out to make a quick buck  br    br   next time take the time and effort and put our an enduring work ',\n  'i found this to be an utter waste of time  effort and money  i know disney always displays lack of creativity when making  straight to video  films   but rehashing the plot of the original film with a  new perspective  is an all time low   soon they ll just be re releasing the original films with new animation and new songs and be calling it a  new version of the movie we all love   nathan lane surprisingly returns to his role of timon yet again  timon and pumbaa the animated animals from the world of the original  lion king  embark on a narrative journey to tell us the original story the way it really happened   as they see it  br    br   of course timon is now the hero of the story  yadda yadda yadda  blah blah blah    br    br   the musical sequences are lame and the animation is crap  the vocal talents are impressive for a video feature  but then again  when was the last time you remember matthew broderick  whoopi goldberg or nathan lane being in anything of real commercial substance  overall if you liked the original you ll hate this  it s insulting because it s unfair to children and adults alike  and that about sums it up ',\n  'there really wasn t much of a story in this film  it loosely based itself off the events in the first lion king movie  it is supposed to be how timon and pumbaa met via their aloneness  but there isn t much more than that  br    br   it mixes some scenes from the original  then it ab libs about how this movie changed them a little bit  but still  is that it  i was hoping for something a little more  instead  all i have to show for it is an empty plot with little explanation  br    br   i guess if you wanted to see other meerkats in the lion king universe  then this is it  but other than that  it does little justice for the animators  disney really should stop these direct to video productions  it really was quite boring and could have used jason statham   d  ',\n  'i give this film it s props that it is very well made and reasonably well acted  but i couldn t get past the implausibility of the whole thing  br    br   first and foremost  a game built around the notion of  russian roulette  that has to fill on hour  the big problem is that if you are doing a  live  show  you run the possibility that your first contestant will be the one unlucky enough to draw the  real  bullet  then what do you do  you have 50 minutes of show to fill and nothing to show  the corollary is that okay  you get to the end and the first five contestants survive  which means number six has the bullet and can t possibly get the payout  he isn t going to shoot himself at that point  so it s kind of anti climatic   br    br   second problem  almost as big  human nature  people are going to flinch  panic  soil their underwear and do things that would otherwise not make very good television  too much randomness  that s why  real  reality television is actually tightly scripted and even more tightly edited  br    br    the only random thing is the  performance artist s  rant about female sacrifices  which were actually rare historically  even that was predictable  since she went through with shooting herself to no effect    br    br   we are led to believe the shows ratings would increase while it was going on at 1 am in the morning  unlikely  with the token asian girl announcing each boost in ratings  br    br   a point on race and sex  big surprise the movies two minority  one gay  and two female contestants are the ones who survive  so we are left with the two white males  and of course  the slightly less likable of them is the one who buys it  the purpose of such a show would be it s randomness  but the guy you like the least is the guy who dies  br    br   the climax is that after spending two hours fighting for televised suicide  the eva mendes character  mendes produced and starred in this thing  so she has no one to blame but herself  actually grows a conscience when someone dies  what did she think was going to happen  she is promptly shot by a bystander angry about the whole thing  motives never explained  and the show went on to be a big hit  really   br    br   the problem with media satire is that it has to either have some grounding in reality or it has to be so over the top to be ludicrous  like network   this is neither ',\n  'live  yes  but not kicking  br    br   true story  some time ago  a dutch tv station made an announcement that they were going to air a new reality show  a contest rather  the main participant in this show would be a woman who was dying of something terrible and she would be donating her kidneys to one lucky person with progressive kidney failure  for real  br    br   the country and the international media were all over this story like flies on a turd  saying it was appalling  immoral  what is this world coming to  and the like  in a way  i had to agree  br    br   as the months passed  the tension built up to a degree that the government was mostly occupied by the issue of whether they should let this show go ahead or not  instead of running the country  br    br   the show did air and right up to the last moment they were pushing ahead  and up to the last moment the country was up in arms  the prime minister making speeches  every newspaper writing about it  everyone in the country holding their breaths  and the network pushed on  towards a new frontier in television  and they definitely succeeded in doing just that  they pushed the envelope  br    br   the show aired and we all watched a terminally ill woman selecting the right candidate to receive her kidneys so he or she would live  whilst she would die shortly after  br    br   and then  in the last moments of the show it was revealed that it was a partial hoax  the woman was not ill  but all the candidates were  there was no kidney auction  the whole show  that  with the publicity and the commercials and all the discussions  built up for months to a fantastic climax  was a publicity stunt to focus attention on the problem of major shortages in organ donors  the man who founded this particular network himself died of kidney disease  br    br   now this is television  leaving everybody far behind in amazement  br    br   don t give me a poorly acted  poorly directed flick about some woman trying to get a russian roulette show on american tv  br    br   as if  br    br    spoiler  as if i m going to believe they would get this through the fcc  as if i m going to believe this would get through the us supreme court on the basis of free expression  as if i m gonna believe the ridiculous ending where this woman pulled it off and has conscience issues because some guy shot himself on air  br    br   it s all been done before  watch running man with arnold instead  at least it had a semi good ending  br    br    spoiler  this is an appallingly bad piece of film  together with a ridiculous ending  so she gets shot in the end  is that supposed to make us movie going public feel better after we leave the theater because there was some kind of justice  don t take my word for it  but i would say this  leave this one alone and watch a test pattern instead  you ll get more quality ',\n  'i really don t understand all these positive user reviews  this movie is the worst movie i ve ever seen and i m not trying to be pessimistic  br    br   eva mendez is hot but terrible in this film  but i don t think it is her own fault but the directors  he have somehow managed to make everything look artificial  their acting  the idea  the make up  everything  br    br   the star i m giving is only for the idea behind the movie  which was very bad executed  br    br   don t watch this bullshit  go watch a fellini  woody allen or some david lynch ',\n  'i heard about this film and knew it wasn t real good  but i started watching the film  on my film channel and was interested  this could be a really great  darkly black satire on todays morals in media  the small featurettes on every contestent were good  it build up to something i wouldn t wanna miss  but when the so called show starts everything becomes implausible  cheap and rather silly  here s where the writer should have added something that would make people think  but instead it s wrapped up and assuming people are this dumb  br    br   the ending is so bad i give it a 1  even if the film starts of promising ',\n  'let s see  in the  st  elsewhere  finale we found out that there was no hospital and that every thing had been in the mind of an autistic child   newhart  ended by telling us that it had all been a dream  and  roseanne  ended by telling us that it all had taken place in her mind  very  creative   annoying was more like it  yes  it was just a tv show and wasn t at all reality  it s just that when you get caught up in a great movie or tv show you end up at least wanting to believe that it s all  real   at least as far as the reality it portrays on screen  this type of series finale had been done twice before and was old hat  frustrating and simply not fun to watch  now  newhart  being all a dream  at least done in a creative way that far exceeded the expectations of anyone who loved the show  the idea itself was not too engaging but it was so brilliantly done that its arguably the best series finale ever  roseanne left me feeling cheated after being such a loyal fan ',\n  'blazing saddles  it s a fight between two estranged brothers  dennis quaid and arliss howard   both of whom can ignite fires mentally  they square off over childhood differences  with dippy love interest debra winger caught in the middle  director glenn gordon caron  the tv whiz kid behind  moonlighting   smothers the darkly textured comedy in vince gilligan s screenplay with a presentation so slick  the movie resembles an entry from an over enthusiastic film student on a fifteen million dollar grant  it has the prickly energy of a big commercial feature  but a shapeless style which brings out nothing from the characters except their kooky eccentricities  these aren t even characters  they re plot functions  barely released to theaters  the film is a disaster  although strictly as an example of style over substance it does look good  winger is the only stand out in a cast which looks truly perplexed   1 2 from     ',\n  'i love these actors  but they were wasted in this flick  br    br   i can only wonder  what were

itself  ',\n  'gene hackman gets himself busted out of prison by a nameless government agency who want him for an assassination  it s a given of course that hackman has the proficient skills for the job  br    br   nobody tells him anything though  he s given as the audience is given bits and pieces of information  that s supposed to be suspenseful  instead it s annoying and boring   br    br   hackman goes through with the mission  but the getaway is messed up and the guy at the top of this mysterious entity orders everybody dead to cover it up  so everyone in the cast dies and at the end you don t really care  br    br   one of the other reviewers pointed out that the film was originally twice as long  almost three hours and got chopped down quite a bit  maybe something really was lost in the translation  but i tend to think it was a mercy act on the audience  br    br   a very talented cast that had people like richard widmark  candice bergen  mickey rooney  eli wallach  and edward albert is so thoroughly wasted here it s a crime   br    br   and we never do find out just what federal agency was doing all this  the fbi  the cia  the dea or even the irs ',\n  'first  it takes a full half hour to get hackman out of jail and to start doing the job  what a waste of time  we all know hackman is getting out to do some job for his masters  why waste almost a third of the movie on these sequences  then hackman stays in a hotel and the story arc again goes nowhere  simply proving to us that hackman is under close watch and anything he says or does is know by the masters  again  another 20 minutes  then more wasted time showing the reunion with his wife  all of this should have taken 10 15 minutes at most simply as a set up for the real action  intrigue and plot twists  by the time the real action gets going  i was so bored that i just wanted the movie to end  hackman is great as usual  and the other actors as well  but this is a dud of the first magnitude ',\n  'there are really two sections of this film  firstly there s the laughable prologue to the film which is so hysterical and cornball that it would almost feel appropriate that the  the simpsons  troy mcclure should be doing the narration  br    br   then the rest of the film begins  starting off with a title song which really doesn t fit in with the rest of the film  which  while technically ok  is killed by a vague  inconsistent and unconvincing plot and not just uninteresting characters  but characters that make no sense  br    br   this is especially so with mickey rooney s spiventa  who was supposedly in on the plot and part of the  organisation  the whole time yet what would have happened had hackman made the seemingly arbitrary decision to take him along when breaking out  in that case he would ve been a totally superfluous and unnecessary character  which in the end he still is  br    br   the overall problem of the film is that it s totally unwilling to put any detail on who or what is behind this conspiracy  it s as if the filmmakers didn t have the courage to imply that a particular section of society would be capable of creating such an organisation and instead settled on the hope that a lack of explanation would suffice and the audience would form their own conclusions  br    br   put simply  the film fails on all levels ',\n  'stanley kramer directs an action thriller and leaves out two key things  action and thrills  the domino principle features gene hackman as a convict sprung from prison in order to perform some mysterious task  richard widmark  edward albert  and eli wallach are his operatives     they presumably work for the government  but that  like most of the movie s plot line  is never made clear  hackman asks a lot of questions that never get answered so the film goes absolutely nowhere  while it strives to be like night moves and the parallax view  the domino principle mixes up ambiguity and mystery with confusion and boredom  the film is extremely well photographed but even that works against it  kramer s direction is devoid of any style  it s a very sunny movie  br    br   the acting is fine with hackman proving he s pretty much incapable of being bad  widmark and wallach are suitably nasty and albert is well cast as widmark s cruel lackey  even the usually obnoxious mickey rooney is pretty good as hackman s sidekick  one oddity however is the casting of candice bergen as hackman s wife  we re told she s done time in prison and she seems to be trying to put on some sort of southern twang  kramer s idea of making her appear to be trailer trash is to have her wear an ugly brown wig  it s a role better suited for the likes of valerie perrine or susan tyrell ',\n  'what did producer director stanley kramer see in adam kennedy s novel and kennedy s very puzzling screenplay  were there a few pieces left out on purpose  and what about gene hackman  richard widmark  edward albert  eli wallach and mickey rooney  what did they see in this very muddled story  br    br   and why did candice bergen  who gave a horrible performance  accept such a thankless role  br    br   the domino principle wants to be on the same footing as the parallax view or the manchurian candidate and misses the mark by a very wide margin  a major misfire by stanley kramer ',\n  ' the domino principle  is  without question  one of the worst thrillers ever made  hardly any sense can be made of the convoluted plot and by the halfway point you ll want to throw your arms up in frustration and scream  i give up     br    br   how gene hackman and director stanley kramer ever got involved in this mess must only be summed up by their paychecks  br    br   i hope they spent their money well ',\n  'this film is notable for three reasons  br    br   first  apparently capitalizing on the success of the two  superman  serials  this low budget feature was made and released to theaters  marking george reeves  and phyllis coates  initial appearances as clark kent   superman and lois lane  part of the opening is re used in the series  outside the town of silby  a six mile deep oil well penetrates the  hollow earth  allowing the  mole men  to come to the surface  forget about the other holes  those in the plot   br    br   second  unlike most sf invasion films of the fifties  the hero plays a dominant  and controlling  force in preaching and enforcing tolerance and acceptance of difference against a raging mob of segregationist vigilantes  no  mild mannered reporter  here  clark kent  knowledgeable and self assertive  grabs control of the situation throughout   i ll handle this     even assisting in a hospital gown in the removal of a bullet from a mole man  as superman  he is gentler than clark towards the feisty lois  but is also the voice of reason and tolerance as he rails against the vigilantes as  nazi storm troopers    br    br   third  you will notice that the transition from the fleisher like cartoon animated flying of superman in the two serials to the  live action  flying in the  adventures of superman  had not yet been made ',\n  ' you re not going to shoot those little creatures  in the first place  they haven t done you any harm  in the second place  they may be radioactive   ah  the joys of no budget 50s sci fi\\x85 yet despite the odd gem like that  superman and the mole men is pretty uninspiring going even with a lean 58 minute running time  it s beyond cheap  the one shot of superman flying is an incredibly inept few frames of animation  and pretty dull with it  though it has a surprisingly altruistic message \\x96 the mute mole men  diminutive actors with enlarged skulls and fur coats who look more like mr mxyzptlk without the hat than subterranean critters  released from their underground world by oil drilling are not malicious  merely misunderstood  and george reeves  man of steel tries to prevent the local small town mob led by jeff corey from killing them  an interesting counterpoint to the paranoia of the day  perhaps  but with little more than good intentions to recommend it ',\n  'back in the 1970s  wpix ran  the adventures of superman  every weekday afternoon for quite a few years  every once in a while  we d get a treat when they would preempt neighboring shows to air  superman and the mole men   i always looked forward to those days  watching it recently  i was surprised at just how bad it really was  br    br   it wasn t bad because of the special effects  or lack thereof  true  george reeves  superman costume was pretty bad  the edges of the foam padding used to make him look more imposing being plainly visible  and true  the mole men s costumes were even worse  what was supposed to be a furry covering wouldn t have fooled a ten year old  since the zippers  sleeve hems and badly pilling fabric badly tailored into baggy costumes were all painfully obvious  but these were forgivable shortcomings  br    br   no  what made it bad were the contrived plot devices  time and again  superman failed to do anything to keep the situation from deteriorating  a lynch mob is searching for the creatures  rather than round up the hysterical crowd or search for the creatures himself  he stands around explaining the dangers of the situation to lois and the pr man  the creatures are cornered  again  he stands around watching and talking but doesn t save them until they re shot  luke benson  the town s rabble rouser  shoots at him  attempted murder to any reasonable person  but superman releases the man over and over to cause more problems  superman had quite a few opportunities to nip the problem in the bud  but never once took advantage of them  br    br   that said  both george reeves and phyllis coates played their characters well  seemingly instantly comfortable in the roles  if only they had been given a better script to work with ',\n  'i just got the uk 4 disc special edition of superman 1 for about  5  the additional stuff includes the 1951 feature superman and the mole men  so i slapped it into the dvd player last night  and here are my findings  br    br   some initial disappointment   i hadn t checked  and i think i had it mentally tagged as one of the kirk alyn serials  i m not a huge fan of george reeves as superman  and i hadn t seen anything other than the odd clip of kirk alyn   but hey ho  never mind  br    br   this black and white production runs for less than an hour  it has the feel of a couple of episodes of one of reeves  early tv series  a two parter  put together for cinema release  although imdb says it was filmed as a cinema release in advance of the first tv series  in any event  it s an odd choice for reasons i ll get to later  i m of an age where i recall tv and movie productions which are limited to one or two locations and sets  so there were no major surprises here  even so  for a low budget movie  this one is really low budget  br    br   the story concerns the small town of silsby   population 1 430   which  puzzlingly  is also home to the world s deepest oil well  6 miles   the story opens with the well s foreman hurriedly taking steps to close the well down  this conflicts with the arrival of metropolis reporters kent and lane to report on the well  at the behest of the oil company  as clark is sniffing out the fact that the drill has emerged into a radioactive cavern 6 miles down  a couple of odd little guys  small in stature  big in head  black in jumpsuit  and bushy in eyebrow  emerge from the capped off drillshaft  and start mooching round town with puzzled expressions on their faces  br    br   a deep breath now  here is the remaining plot of the picture  the little guys scare some kids  so jeff corey  playing the town s rampant xenophobe  incites some pals to kill these  creatures   superman steps in  moderately ineffectually  and catches one of the little guys who has been shot and takes him to the local hospital  corey s pals burn down the shack the other little fellow has hidden in and assume he is killed  but he escapes and legs it down the shaft  corey incites a lynch mob  despite the sheriff arresting him  to hang the hospitalised mole man  superman stops them entering the hospital and takes the injured chappie to the shaft to return him to his fellows  a total of 4 mole men emerge with a weapon of some sort which they fire at jeff corey  i call this an aargh  gun because its sole effect seems to be to make corey go  aargh    and superman saves him  he immediately changes his ways because of amazement at superman saving him after the way he has behaved  the mole men go back down the shaft  the end  br    br   despite the film only being an hour long  there is an inordinate amount of creeping around  bewareing and pursuing   i have left out all the  mole man 1 creeps from a to b  looking out to make sure no one is following him  stuff  the mole men are never engaged in any way whatsoever   they have no dialogue   they just turn up  get persecuted  and go back  they do look a little creepy  but they are hardly the bug eyed monsters that the town s reaction implies  br    br   reeves is quite a good clark kent   very much a hard nosed reporter  much more so than phyllis coates  rather indifferent lois lane  but he is a terrible  terrible superman  not only does he not look the part  at least his hair is dyed black in this  which is an improvement from the rather light hair he sported in some of the tv episodes   the way he plays it is all wrong in my book  i m sure he was told to  strike the pose   which superman does constantly   but someone should have told him that it should be fists on hips  not fists on ribs  and he plays superman as a rather strict and touchy schoolteacher   he doesn t actually wag his finger in remonstration  but he may as well have done  br    br   and superman does a huge amount of walking around  i say a huge amount   he isn t actually in it all that much   and a bit of running  he takes off and lands a couple of times  but isn t seen in flight at any point  oh  some bullets bounce off him  and he uses telescopic vision as clark  but with no accompanying visual effect  in fact  visual effects are conspicuous by their absence  and the few which are present aren t very good  br    br   i ve tried to consider this effort by reference to the standards of the time  but even by those standards i think it s a pretty threadbare effort  thankfully  production standards on the tv series were higher  and at least they took the trouble to come up with stories which had a bit more to them  br    br   something of a disappointment   i shan t be watching it again ',\n  'this movie was just plain bad  just about every cop movie

chemistry to begin with  not to mention that james seemed to have a total sexist view in the movie despite the fact the writer wasn t going in that direction  james just really ticked me off for more

amateurish effort contains seeds of a very interesting social commentary  in the 5  years since it was released  the premise has been made less outrageous by real world events in software development  and i found it less boring than the previous commentator for that reason  i imagine    the director clearly is a fan of hitchcock  and it s too bad that the film was not better executed  but in fact  it is nearly a parody of pulp fiction  including the soundtrack screeching at us when we are supposed to pay attention  one can almost see the exclamation points and capital letters on a yellowing

stereotypes  virtually  no name  cast and an obviously low budget i thought this film was alright  much better than i expected it to be  i was skeptical at first   the idea of a computer virus that

disease killing people  br    br   the writer appears to have simply lifted clichés from other movies as a substitute for writing lines adapted to actual characters  the actors did not help matters  no chemistry  i guess they were supposed to develop some kind of attraction if only for the reason that such is an essential element of these stories  however  the writers didn t work very hard to develop the chemistry  sure  they re both attractive  but whether they re attractive to each other seemed to be an open question  br    br   the confidence turner s character shows in sabato s developed far too quickly and for no particular reason  sabato s character is supposed to be a discredited doctor who just can t seem to play by the rules  think of the jeff goldblum character in

skills of a magic eight ball  he appears to be right by random chance  br    br   the death scenes are comical  every actor was really trying more than a little to hard to demonstrate the agony inflicted on them  the symptoms looked like bad claymation  sort of like that video from the 80s  peter gabriel  i think ',\n  'ok  the movie is good but i give it a 1 because the idea of a computer virus becoming an organic virus is pure fairy tale  this kind of crap just adds to those uncomputer savvy moron s paranoid delusions that a computer virus is exactly like an organic virus  first of

universe  organic virus s attach burrow into your cells and attach themselves to the rna  then change your own rna code  explain to me how something like that could be processed from a monitor  maybe the radiation has some effect on the user s cornea that turns your eyeballs into these viruses  i could see that  but obviously  the writer didn t think of that ',\n  'i ve just lost 2 hours of my

here was   to say the least   a bit rough around the edges  thus science fiction  with the emphasis on the fiction  but somehow rukh harnesses some sort of ray from andromeda that allows him to look at the earth  several thousand million years ago   in that pre historic time  a huge meteorite slammed into africa  leaving deposits of a substance the scientists call  radium x    which can heal and

infecting himself with some sort of disease that makes him a great weapon as well  br    br   karloff and lugosi were both pretty good here  lugosi pulls off a role in which he s the good guy pretty well  although i frankly found him a bit unconvincing   especially during the scenes set in africa  the story also plodded along a bit  and while it held my attention it didn t captivate me  given that this is really a sci fi rather than a horror flick  and that sci fi was in its very early stages  i suppose the movie needs to be cut a bit of slack  it was ok   nothing more  but also nothing

more times  including last week  i regret i have to be a voice of dissension with regard to mr  branagh s performance  br    br   this is really a glorious  sumptuous film  to say nothing of ambitious at over 4 hours long   beautifully shot and designed  derek jacobi  julie christie  kate winslet  richard briers  and many others do fine jobs  then there s kenneth branagh  if ever there was a vanity project for an actor  this is it  and mr  branagh spares nothing in putting the  ham  in hamlet  from the stunt casting  which gives us the worst performance ever by the woefully miscast jack lemmon   to the bits of distracting business thrown in to infuse a sense of  naturalness   to his own performance which runs the gamut from throwing away the single most famous soliloquy in all of literature to screaming every line of others  his performance confirms that  while he may come across better on stage where bigger is necessary  he has never been a great film actor  the scenery budget could be charged to catering  mr  branagh eats so much of it  his performance is a perfect example of why people don t go to see shakespeare    full of sound and fury  signifying nothing   and if there is fault to his direction  it is that he keeps the camera firmly glued on his overblown performance  br    br   no matter what theories people may posit on the bard  he was  after all is said and done  a playwright  the brilliance of his plays rest in the fact that his themes are universal and timeless  although there is no  right  way to play his plays  there is most certainly great acting  good acting and bad acting  shakespeare himself gives instructions to the players in the text of  hamlet  itself  it amazes me how mr  branagh  mouthed  it  but did not hear it  it was an example of spending too much time working out how he s going to say something  and too little figuring out what he s saying  br    br   while mr  branagh has certainly done a wonderful job in mounting some entertaining productions  he would be wise to stay behind the camera and allow those who know the art of acting to practice it  his direction has always been better than his acting  i still give him immense credit for resurrecting interest in filming shakespeare  he set a great template for other productions  and  it would be interesting to see him onstage  from about 20 rows back  but  i do hope he chooses to direct more and act less  br    br   is it worth seeing  certainly  there are many little joys to be found in the film  but  it s a long  long movie and  by the end  one may feel less that they enjoyed than survived it ',\n  'this ludicrous and inept film is certainly the most misguided version of  hamlet  to ever reach the screen  branagh s approach to the material can only be described as vulgar  going to such lengths as depicting ophelia in a straight jacket  having fortinbras  army appear suddenly on the horizon  looking very much like the climax of  monty python and the holy grail   when the palace is apparently guarded only by francisco  who shouts the very un shakespearean cry of  ataaaaaaaaaaaaaaaack  before being gunned down   and multitudes of star cameos that harken back to the days of jimmy cagney s bottom and mary pickford s kate  br    br   branagh chose to set his film in an edwardian setting but at the same time decided to employ an almost uncut text  so that frequently the dialogue that is firmly rooted in elizabethan mentality makes no sense in the context that it is being performed  and branagh does not concern himself with such textural subtleties as the ambiguous nature of hamlet and olphelia s relationship  treating the audience to a vulgar nude sex scene between the couple that tosses any ambiguity right out the stained glass window  br    br   the uncut text does allow branagh to indulge in his favorite cinematic pastime  more footage of kenneth branagh  this is never so apparent as in the  how all occasions inform against me  speech that ends the first half of the nineteen hour film  at least that s how it feels   which attempts to play to a dramatic crescendo along the lines of gone with the wind s  i ll never be hungry again   this may serve branagh s ego  but it does not serve shakespeare or the speech  when i saw the film in the theater  i leaned over to my companion and snickered  great moments with mr  hamlet   branagh saves the funniest and most tasteless moment for last  when he attempts to out do the olivier film and its justly celebrated death of claudius by having hamlet jump from off a high tower onto the monarch  impaling him with a sword  branagh s dane does in the king by heroically throwing an apparently magic rapier from across the palace to run through claudius  heart with a super hero s bulls eye  the only thing that saved the moment from being unbearably maddening was that it was so off the wall funny  br    br   while this film has been praised in some quarters as a serious depiction of the tragedy  it is in fact nothing but a star studded display of a once talented filmmaker being overtaken by his own narcissism  the emperor has no clothes  and this hamlet has nothing to offer but a few unintended laughs and the appalling sight of one man s ego out of control ',\n  'despite positive reviews and screenings at the international festivals  this movie is not for

and clumsy  the dramatic situations  in which she tries to show some emotions  are dreadful  her body and facial language are of amateur actress  badly instructed by the director  the rest of the cast is a little better  but they just cannot save this cliché movie with stereotypical characters and shallow plot  besides a few relatively good moments this movie has nothing new or interesting to offer  br    br   even the kung fu fighting is not a reason to watch this  it s just so boring  the slow motion was really unnecessary  the choreography was basic and lacked the inspiration  and most of the

opinion  they already did ',\n  'this show is awful  how is george wanting the death of his mother funny  this show is terrible  the parents are obviously horrible and the children should be taken to child services  the daughter is a witch with a b and the son is just a complete brat  george isn t funny  especially when he speaks his loud and obnoxious brand of spanglish  ernie is a loser  but at least i ve chuckled at him a few times  but mainly at how pathetic he is  george s mother  benny  in an awful  despicable character  sure  her husband left her  but how anyone can laugh at the way she treated george as a baby is beyond me  br    br   can someone explain to me how george s head being big is funny  it s not even that big  i ve moved on from characters because they re too awful and it would take hours for me to write and i  frankly  don t care enough  i do care enough to tell anyone looking at this and wondering whether or not they want to watch this show  that this show is an abysmal excuse for a sitcom  and is not worth your time  br    br   i give it 2 starts  because the wife is extremely attractive ',\n  'seriously  i mean very seriously  when i first started watching the show i thought it was good  but the plots just got worse  the storyline were either too boring or predictable  george isn t always funny  he sometimes acts stupid  his jokes are overdone  his mom is the silliest character of the show  how can a mother treat her own son that way  okay if it was the daughter in law  but this was her own son  i give this show a 4 10 just because the first few shows were a little funny  the actors constance marie and masiela lusha do a great job  don t know how these shows get to play for so long   br    br   if you re really bored like i was and have nothing else to watch  i d suggest you watch this ',\n  'what has ireland ever done to film distributers that they seek to represent the country in such a pejorative way  this movie begins like a primer for film students on irish cinematic cliches  unctuous priests  spitting before handshakes  town square cattle marts  cycling by country meadows to the backdrop of anodyne folk music  quickly  however  it becomes apparent that the main theme of the film is the big daddy o of irish cliches   religous strife  it concerns a protestant woman who wants to decide where her catholic fathered child is educated  which would seem like a reasonable enough wish  though not to the  50 s county wexford villagers she has to live with  rather than send them to a catholic school  she decides to up and leave for belfast  then scotland  where a few more cliches are reguritated  while she s there  her father  who looks eerily like george lucas  and family back home are subjected to a boycott  which turns very nasty  i m not going to give away the ending  not because i think people should go see this movie  but because it s not very interesting  one of the problems with the film is the central character  we re supposed to sympathise with her but end up instead urging her to get a life  the villagers are presented as bigots whose prejudices should be stood up to  but traumatising your kids seems an innappropriate way to go about it  in addition  it takes on burdens which it staggers igniminiously under when it tries to draw analogies with the current northern ireland peace process  the woman is told by her lawyer that she  must lay down preconditions  for her return  the film is allegedly based on a true story but it s themes have been dealt with much more imaginatively  and with less recourse to hackneyed cliches  in the past ',\n  'i can not believe such slanted  jingoistic material is getting passed off to americans as art house material  early on  from such telling lines like  we want to make sure they are playing for the right team  and manipulative framing and lighting  a love divided shows it s true face  the crass manner in which the irish catholics are shown as hegemonic  the protestants as peaceful and downtrodden  is as poor a representation of history as early us westerns that depict the struggle between cowboys and american indians  the truth of the story is distorted with the stereotypes and outright vilification of the irish catholics in the story  a corruption admitted by the filmmakers themselves  it is sad that people today still think that they can win moral sway by making a film so easily recognized for it s obvious intent  so far from attempting art  this film has no business being anywhere in any legitimate cinema or library ',\n  'i remember i saw this cartoon when i was 6 or 7  my grandfather picked up the video of it for free at the mall  i remember that it really sucked  the plot had no sense  i hated the fox that became casper s friend  he was so stupid  casper cried his head off if he couldn t find a friend  so what  get over it  the only good part and i don t want to sound mean spirited was when the fox got shot and died at the end  i laughed my head off in payback because this cartoon sucked so much  the bad news is the fox resurrects and becomes a ghost  i wish he had stayed dead  i think i even gave the video of this to somebody because i hated it  no wonder they were offering it for free at the mall  if you have a child don t let them watch this  they will probably agree with me that it sucks ',\n  'john candy  need we say more  he is the main reason you should see this film  most people don t realize how gifted he was as an actor  witness him changing from poor slob to horny jerk  just a simple subtle  facial change and off we go  there are many great bits in this movie and many really dumb bits  the best moments for me are the kung fu u scenes as well as the great moment when john in a trance  goes up on stage and talks about how much he loves his girlfriend that is how much he and his genitals love his girlfriend  i m sure reading this you might think this sequence sounds really crude  it is  but it is also very funny mainly because it is john candy doing this bit  the story in general is pretty lame and eugene levy and joe flaherty both sctv alumni with candy  are not given enough to do in the film  levy has his moments  especially filming the wedding at the end think rod serling  and the great scene when he is talking to his mother on the phone  overall a good movie if you have had a tough day and need to put your brain on stupid  i give this one 4 out of 10 ',\n  'this movie appears to have been made by someone with some good ideas but who also never had made a movie before nor had they considered that a script should be edited or even funny  when i saw this film  i saw it for john candy and assumed  incorrectly  that it would be hilarious  instead  there was a stupid plot about mind control and so many flat  unfunny moments  and  to top it off  candy delivered some of the crudest lines i had ever heard up to that time  so  despite a potentially funny cast and story idea  we are left with an amateurish and crude movie that will probably be too stupid for the average adult  though teens will probably find a few laughs  it s really a shame  it could have been so much better  i mean  with eugene levy  joe flaherty and john candy it should have been wonderful ',\n  'no  not the administration of gwb  the decider strutter smirker  but the mini

movies skip this very important part  the faith of all of us christians lies in this very event  as paul says in one of his letters  if christ did not rise from the dead  our faith is vain   a very

these people would ever be cast in a professional production of macbeth  hearing david lansbury s soft voice struggling laboriously with the famous  tomorrow  tomorrow  and tomorrow  speech made it impossible to believe anyone would ever consider him for the role  i kept believing therefore that he didn t get the part because he was a lousy actor  not because a bigger name was available  then when we see portions of the play in rehearsal it is difficult to believe the director is not parodying things with a hopelessly miscast  misdirected travesty of actors who are unable to articulate or even understand the verse and directors who see the play through their own screwball interpretations  sometimes directors are so anxious to have their films done  and writers think they have the ability to direct their own works that they settle for less  this appears to be such an example ',\n  'i agree with most of the columbo fans that this movie was an unnecessary change of format  columbo is a unique cop with unorthodox police methods  this movie looks like a remake of any other ordinary detective dramas from the past  and that is the disturbing point  because columbo is no

vanishing bride  or something similar  second  columbo hides a piece of evidence without offering the reason  to the viewers at least  why he does it  br    br   i don t feel betrayed  just

whose rough exterior can scare anybody  yet whose heart is clearly in the right place from the very start    and he does an amazing job  he was quite clearly the best character in the movie  br    br   this was certainly a performance that will not win morgan freeman any awards  after starring in powerhouse films like the shawshank redemption this film was certainly a step down  his role in edison simply did not allow him to show his true talents as an actor    and in terms of the conglomeration of characters placed him sadly on a back burner  there are so many ways his character  moses ashford  could have taken a more pivotal role  that he didn t was disappointing and a true let down  i was hoping to see more from him in this film  br    br   timberlake ought to have stayed in the music industry  his portrayal of a young journalist was poorly acted and unpersuasive  this movie is a typical action movie that  at least initially  bears some resemblance to corrupt police affairs la has experienced in the past  being an action movie  it has its share of shoot em up scenes  blood  and guts  these scenes are typically unrealistic and painfully predictable  watching the beginning of the movie there is very little suspense as to what will happen at the end    think of what you would typically expect in a good cops bad cops conflict    and it bears little resemblance to a real police shoot out  br    br   what irked me most was the way timberlake s character behaved during shoot out scenes  he starts out having guns and not using them  then when he finally gets around to using one he fires it as if he s been firing a gun his whole life  then he runs out of bullets and doesn t have a gun    and 30 seconds later  without moving or anything    suddenly has 2 more fully loaded guns and extra ammo   little plot errors like this really ruined the movie for me  br    br   if what you are looking for is a blatantly fictional plot in a fantasy world where everything turns out okay  then you ll probably love this movie  personally  it doesn t matter to me what kind of movie it is as long as it is realistic  make me believe that the story is true  this story was so obviously fictional in so many aspects that i came away feeling unsatisfied ',\n  'beginning with the poster  featuring only morgan freeman and kevin spacey   the entire movie was a fraud  one stereotype after

flick  br    br   basically  the story is about the corrupt system in some city  all secretly supported by the backbone business and in town  under the watchful eye of some hot shot politician  the almighty and above the law organization is called frat and guess what  they ve got a kick ass loony cop shooting and beating at will   suspects  girlfriends  you name it  frat cops are corrupt and greedy  so they end up making mistakes that get discovered by a young and talented       journalist  one hour later  after a series of unbelievably bad made shooting scenes and more stereotype lines

off strong  ll cool j  deed  as an undercover police officer  with partner sgt  lazerov  dylan mcdermott from the practice  possibly miscast as a bad guy   committing robbery and murder  deed refuses

to fall short as soon as justin timberlake  pollack  is introduced  given the opportunity to make a good movie that people will possibly see repeatedly  or one that teenage girls will go and see the once because of timberlake  i would choose the former  even talented actors have to work hard at their craft  timberlake is not talented and no amount of hard work can save him  i would have thought he would put on a better show  given the fact that he has been acting talented for years  everything he did in this film was unconvincing  br    br   just because a singer sells millions of records and sells out stadiums  it does not automatically translate that they can act successfully in feature films  even hardcore n sync fans will not be able to ignore the obvious lack of acting talent  br    br   that aside there are a few plot holes  such as pollack s sudden sniper ability and deadly operation of warehouse machinery  this movie had so much promise  thoroughly disappointing ',\n  'lets enter the world of this movie for a second  so you can better understand the type of movie we are dealing with here  br    br   edison is one of those really stupid movies where the bad guy and his goons have been letting loose 50 000 bullets shooting at the good guy behind walls and pillars  shouting at them  and then finally get to the good guy face to face and instead of killing him      instead of wasting this guy that has caused you so much grief    instead of just walking up and pop      what do you do  the bad guy     he talks to him  he grabs the good guy and talks to him while holding his gun  they have nothing to talk about  shoot him  shoot him now  but he talks to him anyway  oh another thing  at the end  a newspaper says  pulitzer prize winner story right here  or something right above on a front page of a paper  when its like the first time the story is printed  so how in the heezy did someone win a pulitzer for it that fast  yea  you know those types of

literally every single moment of the movie while proposing to his girlfriend in a damn night club of all places and who s last line  duck  was something from like a lethal weapon movie that was never made    and justin timberlake whining and spewing nonsense every time he talks  little cocky bastard the only bright spot was a crazy dylan mcdermott doing his best  denzel from training day

what they both thought  blah blah blah  its like a bootleg pelican brief meets a halfassed training day the pacing was slow and off  the script was horrible  and the acting was extremely uninspired  it jumped everywhere without going anywhere  people get put in comas and you forget about them  everyone in this movie just didn t think  damn what a stupid movie  its becoming harder to write any sort of review for it because the movie left my brain the second it ended   no lie basically  do not waste your time ',\n  'honestly before i watched this movie  i had heard many people said this movie was a disgrace  i did not believe that since morgan freeman and kevin spacey have taken roles in this movie  and watched it by my own  apparently they were right  i was really disappointed and wondering all the time during the movie   why the hell did i watch this movie  br    br   of course i was not expecting much from justin as he really does not belong in the movie theater business  but morgan and kevin  i could not stop asking myself why the heck they agreed to take part in edison  to be honest  their roles are rather stupid  br    br   well you might think if the players suck  then i should pay more attention to the story  it is indeed story is the core of a movie  but guys    trust me    this is not a movie you want to give a credit for its story  imagine this  a smart ass journalist  justin timberlake  wrote a story against the system and at the same time learning how to become a  real  journalist from his boss  morgan freeman   this all was supported by one agent who still has heart for justice  ll cool j  and an brilliant investigator  kevin spacey   at the end  they beat the system with a happy ending story  br    br   jeez  i could not even carry on with this  just recalling the movie is making me sick already  my advise guys  don t watch this  please save your money and time for another movie ',\n  'there is an excellent reason edison went straight to video  it would have landed in theaters with a crumbling thud  the movie lasted entirely too long and was perilously boring  just a notch above lowbrow  thanks to freeman and spacey  who obviously had a spare two weeks before their next films   the bad guys are as laughable and action as near non existent as justin timberlake s acting  i hate to knock the guy  but the sooner he realizes that pop is his forte  the better  br    br   the movie isn t all bad   just mostly  i like the fact that ll cool j was given what appears to be a shot at being leading man  he deserves it  and  unlike his fellow musician and co star  he can act  kevin spacey is almost always enjoyable as well  you can see him gulp several times as he chews the scenery   and freeman has the ability to elevate this flick to three stars  out of ten   he s not that good   br    br   when all is said and done  the ultimate error with this movie is that it is a mundane and tiresome piece of pseudo action poppycock that fails to keep anyone awake  it also fails to make anyone give a good crap about any of the characters  all in all  t s just plain boring  that being said  rent this when you are suffering from insomnia ',\n  'oh dear god  this was horrible  there is bad  then there was this  this movie makes no sense at all  it runs all over the map and isn t clear about what its saying at all  the music seemed like it was trying to be like batman  the fact that  edison  isn t a real city  takes away  since i live in vancouver  watching this movie and recognizing all these places made it unbearable  why didn t they make it a real city  the only writing that was decent was tilman  in which john heard did a fantastic job  he was the only actor who played his role realistically and not over the top and campy  it was actually a shame to see john heard play such a great bad guy with a lot of screen time  and the movie be a washout  too bad  hopefully someone important will see it  and at least give john heard credit where credit is due  and hire him as lead bad guy again  which is where he should be  on the a list ',\n  'the movie itself is not too bad  many comments have pointed out the obvious flaws of the script  but it is watchable  what really gives me the creeps though is that people like justin timberlake even get cast for movies  and on top of that for movies like this one  i have to admit i had never heard the man s name before watching this  but the very instant he appeared i was just plain annoyed  the voice is crap  the face is a bad rip off of legolas  the posture is horrible  and he cannot even properly coordinate all three of them  said to say  i was delighted when he got jumped after leaving the disco  because i was hoping from then on it would be morgan freeman and kevin spacey only  too bad i was wrong  these two and also ll cool j give a very decent performance  and they are the main reason i give this a 4   br    br   i see many upcoming movies with the little timberlake cast    and cannot believe it ',\n  'pathetic    worse than a bad made for tv movie  i can t believe that spacey and freeman were in this flick  for some reason morgan freeman s character is constantly talking about and saying  pussy  when referring to nsync boy s girlfriend  morgan freeman calling women  pussy  is just awkward    what the hell were the people behind this film thinking  too many plot holes to imagine combined with the horrid acting  confusing camera angles  a lame script and cheap background music made this movie absolutely unbearable  br    br   i rented this flop

 ll cool j played the typical rapper role  toughest baddest guy around  i don t think the cracked a smile in the whole movie  not even when proposed to his girlfriend  br    br   morgan freeman pretty much carried the whole movie  he was has some funny scenes which are the high point of the movie  br    br   kevin spacey wasn t good or bad he was just  there   br    br   overall it s a dull movie

wtf is timberlake  dreaful acting  i think someone like joshua jackson could have done a much better job  this job was perfect for joshua jackson and believe me i am not a big fun of him    but i really prefer an actor  not this android called timberlake  and his girlfriend was shallow  hollow and annoying as hell  i was happy when they both were popped in the street  br    br   the story was ok and i think dylan mc dermott did his bad guy role very well  the movie was entertaining but i think timberlake ruined it all  it would have been much enjoyable without him  br    br   by the way

through the forehead and still had the forethought to turn to his shooter and smile before collapsing  just awful  the real tipoff to how bad this flick is to see freeman on the cover and throughout the movie sporting an unruly beard  looking like nothing so much as a hobo  you just know the director was not in control  freeman is clearly slumming ',\n  'i rented this movie last week  i saw kevin spacey and morgan freeman were on it  so it seemed promising  and it was  until justin timberlake came on scene  he is a really bad actor and shouldn t be allowed to make a movie ever again  i mean

would have been a better choice  br    br   kevin spacey was another big disappointment  his character is so dull  it seems like a bad mix of his character in american beauty and john doe in se7en  it

it sounded interested and had some top actors in it like kevin spacey and morgan freeman  how bad could it be  right  well  it s pretty bad  justin timberlake plays pollack  a wannabe journalist who stumbles across a case that may lead to corrupt cops at edison s police force  ll cool j is deed  a cop within the force on a special force team called f r a t   first response assault tactics   he s teamed with an  on the edge  bad cop named lazerov  dylan mcdermott   in the opening scene we see lazerov   deed taking on some bank robbers  but at night they are busting a couple of guys doing drugs  i don t want to give to much away  but things turn bad for the guys doing the drugs  pollack  who works for ashford  morgan freeman  goes to a trial involving deeds   lazerov  he suspect foul play and with the help of ashford  does some investigate that turns ugly  wallace  kevin spacey  who is all within the f r a t  team joins with ashford to try to bring the corrupt cops to justice  br    br   you can tell from the beginning that freeman and spacey s performance are pretty lackluster  the only person that give a all out performance is dylan mcdermott  he is a complete nut case in this movie and made a believer out of me  ll cool j is terrible in this film  he says every line the same way and shows pretty much the same emotion  he was much better in movies like deep blue sea   any given sunday  the film starts off with some nice action but then drags it feet through the rest of the film  the ending is far from satisfying  br    br   don t waste your time with this film  i m putting it on ebay this weekend ',\n  'the plot of  edison  was decent  but one actor in particular ruined the entire film  justin timberlake ruined the film with every line he uttered during the

silent scene  justin timberlake managed to ruin it   br    br   do not waste your time watching this film  don t even bother downloading it  midget porn would be a much better choice  br    br   and justin  if you re reading this  stick to music  even though you re no good at that  you ve done a wonderful job tricking people into thinking you can actually sing ',\n  'i found it very very difficulty to watch this after the initial 5 minutes of the film  i managed to stomach 45 50 minutes before switching it off in disgust and watching monster house instead  which  by the way  is great fun   br    br   the story has massive holes in it  the plot line is hugely over stated and dull  the acting is awful  especially from justin timberlake who should really stick to what he is good at  looking daft and singing like a castrato   morgan freeman looked incredibly uncomfortable  especially when made to dance around to rock music for no apparent reason half way through the film after him and timberlake meet  freeman and timberlake s characters seem to be supposed to have some sort of father son relationship of sorts or something  which simply isn t evident at all apart from the fact that  though freeman s character seems to have nothing but contempt for the ignorant and rather stupid character of timberlake  he never the less pulls out all the stops to help him uncover a completely ridiculous cover up  br    br   it would take some incredible suspension of disbelief to give any credit to the story line  which is simply absurd and blown out of all proportion  br    br   don t watch this film  it is a pure waste of time ',\n  'ok so i hear about this new justin timberlake movie coming out which features some pretty big names  i mean great actors like  the freeman aka morgan freeman  an asset to hollywood  however completely wasted in this film  then we got kevin spacey  who i ve been a great fan of ever since i watched american beauty and the usual suspects  both of these great actors probably signed on to the movie thinking it was going to be a great movie as i did when i heard the story  then enter a fresh faced justin timberlake  i say fresh faced because this is his first movie and those rotten tomatoes haven t hit him yet  well the reason for that   i might add  is because no one will ever see this movie or even bother reading this review  the movie is so terrible that when i got into the first 15 minutes of it  the characters were so one dimensional that it makes some bible characters look like the don corleone  they got the one liners and sound bite worthy stuff  the token troubled black guy  ll cool j  who is with a gorgeous woman who he otherwise would not even belong with in real life  the captain is this short whiny guy who speaks in such a high tone  and what crappy movie would be complete without the hero becoming richer because of an experience  oh and lots of gun fire  i mean a whole lot  spoiler not     the kind of gun fire that leaves everyone in the police force who s crooked dead and the hero prevails  they got flame throwers and rocket launchers  really no kidding  br    br   bottom line if you want to see edison its because you are a great fan of one of the actors  or a great fan of justin timberlake  to all the 13 year old girls out there  enjoy   i wish i had more hands  because then i would have more thumbs  because this movie is so terrible because then i could give it so many thumbs down that thumbs down would no longer mean anything because this movie is so terrible because it sucks so badly that it made me laugh out of frustration about the story line because it just would not end because the firing and yelling just kept happening  br    br   may g d have mercy on us all and save us from these terrible movies  well it could be worst  another rnb terrible actor turned singer turned terrible actor is usher  hehe check out in the mix lol  or even get rich or die trying   now the special thing about that movie is that its got 30  year old men  playing 16 or even younger teens  i could go on with these ',\n  'when you go at an open air cinema under the greek summer night you usually don t care what the movie is  edison started really good with some good effort from the singers who want to be actors and a once again great morgan freeman but     in a movie there is usually a good start to catch audience done  a bit boring yet story filling middle of the movie that is more about characters and less about action  done  and the third part is something really good so that you can remember the movie     when you see 30 elite police officers  packed with weapons that can demolish a building  shoot at a guy behind a car  fail to hit him even once while he kills all  but 3  and then the guy takes out a flame thrower  to kill the rest 3   you realise that the greek summer sky filled with stars is way too good to be distracted by a movie like this ',\n  'jewish newspaper

about japanese pop culture  other than that  i am spanish  i eat paella and i like black humor  br    br   good  with that point set  i can comment on the movie  i have no idea on how it is enjoyable to the japanese audiences  mamoru oshii is quite a good director  despite the overly pedantic postmodern stuff in the style of talking head  and even that was curious and somehow interesting  and i am surprised he came up with this  it may just be one of those lost in translation cases  i am afraid it is  but as a european viewer watching the film with subtext overloaded english subtitles i just thought it was horrible  the jokes seemed bad  the script was overcooked  i mean  give the audience a break  and shut up a little you damn narrator  to the point of almost making my head explode over an overkill of fast paced speaking and absurd action  br    br   however  i thought the animation was really cool  the idea is great  and it is well exploited in those animated scenes  however  the eye candy finishes as soon as the characters are left aside to start with an endless not funny at all mumbo jumbo speech over still pictures  it just makes you want to fast forward to the next cut out hysterical characters scene  br    br   i read mamoru oshii is actually planning on a sequel for this  the idea was good but horribly exploited  maybe the second part will bring up the good parts of this first one and actually make an interesting movie  or maybe it will be more and more over narrated scenes  but hell  if you thought talking head was dense  amazing lifes of fast food gifters will give cause you a stroke  br    br   of course  all this comment is based on the experiences of someone who is european  probably this is totally useless to japanese people  maybe it was a really funny film lost in cultural frontiers and translation  maybe ',\n  'i don t want to go too far into detail  because i can t really justify wasting much time on reviewing this film  but i had to give an alternate opinion to hopefully help people avoid the movie  the animation is crud and the story alternates between boring pointless to extremely irritating  the humor was completely lost on the audience  and yes   ghost in the shell fans  this is not an action sci fi or anything like that   its an attempt at slapstick comedy  and the humor just did not work after being translated  it was a total chore to watch this movie  and horrible way for me to kick off the film fest  especially considering how excited i was and how open i was for anything   i wasn t expecting a ghost in the shell sequel  but i was expecting something entertaining  and it simply didn t achieve this  yaaawwnnn    rent kino s journey instead ',\n  'i rented this on dvd and i kind of feel bad since dawson and lugacy are so earnest about it in the dvd comments  it s not a bad movie exactly  but it s one of those films that desperately wants to be a deep comment on human nature while not realizing that its story is practically a genre  plus  it is a little simplistic about the issue in a lot of ways  and the characters  behavior often strains belief  i d say its a film that you would get something out of if you don t have a lot of film tv literature life behind you  to be honest  i ve seen almost exactly the same story in horror comics even   otherwise  its point has been made before and more artfully  and that gets to the big problem  which is that it really doesn t have much of cinematic interest to it besides the point  it ends up being a fairly bland movie overall that invests everything in the idea that the basic story will be shocking and compelling  and it doesn t really pay off ',\n  'the plot for descent  if it actually can be called a plot  has two noteworthy events  one near the beginning   one at the end  together these events make up maybe 5  of the total movie time  everything  and i mean  everything   in between is basically the director s desperate effort to fill in the minutes  i like disturbing movies  i like dark movies and i don t get troubled by gritty scenes   but if you expect me to sit through 60 minutes of hazy dark  literally  scenes with no storyline you have another thing coming  rosario dawson  one of my favorite actresses is completely wasted here  and no  she doesn t get naked  not even in the nc 17 version  which i saw  br    br   if you have a couple of hours to throw away and want to watch  descent   take a nap instead   you ll probably have more interesting dreams ',\n  'i saw  descent  last night at the stockholm film festival and it was one huge disappointment  disappointment because the storyline was potentially powerful  the prospect of seeing rosario dawson in a smaller intimate movie was exciting and  being a fan  sounds pervy  i m not   of  rape revenge  flicks of the 70 s  i was needless to say very curious to check this movie out  my conclusion  let s stick to the classics  yes  the storyline has potential but the dialogs are flat  the actors unconvincing  even dawson is empty  some would say that it s a right depiction of the college world in the us  that the emptiness of the characters serve a purpose and all that jazz but it just makes the whole movie unsubstantial  just like the scene where dawson gets raped  it seriously lacks intensity  i wasn t expecting anything  irreversible  style but still  aren t we suppose to feel compassion for her  i didn t  not for a minute  she was so lame all the way     and i read that the photography was impressive  well  it is good indeed but nothing ground breaking either  i must admit that the screening at the festival wasn t so good so maybe i missed out something here but at the end of the movie  i couldn t help thinking  i feel like watching argento s  inferno  again  lol  more seriously  the first scene in the club is beautifully shot and all but i had the bitter sensation of watching a longer and more boring version of the scene in the filthy bar near the american canadian border in lynch s  twin peaks   fire walk with me     the crude red and blue lighting  the heavy bass music  the general lascivious decadent atmosphere    no  i just couldn t get into this movie  too bad ',\n  'it s pretty bad when the generic movie synopsis has more information than the film itself  the paragraph long  plot summary  written on the movie page has details i could not glean from watching the actual movie  i found myself constantly backing it up to see what details i had just missed which could tell me what the  bleep  was going on  alas  to no avail  this movie leaves out monstrous pieces of the story  if you could call it a story  it s like they were trying to fool us into thinking that there was some kind of movie here  filming just enough so that there was the resemblance of a story and leaving the rest to our imaginations  newsflash to the the creators  i paid to watch you make a movie  i can sit home and imagine plots and story lines for free  and rosario dawson  this is somebody i ve never paid enough attention to to be able to put the name to the face  and i can see why  she had one of the most artificial performances i have ever seen for a leading character in any movie  a or b  i figured okay  maybe she didn t really want the role  just got a hefty offer for a movie she wasn t into  wrong  she was listed as one of the producers  next time you produce something  don t book yourself as the lead if you can t act  if you really can  then create a decent character for you to become  also  somebody here mentioned the white latino issue  yes  i hate to say it  but this movie does come across as an act of vengeance against white college age males who wear baseball hats  that s what happens when there is nothing in the movie to endear the watcher to latino characters  the adrian character seems like a cocky jerk who is no better than the story s antagonist  as for the maya character  she didn t seem like a real person  anyway i m ashamed for hollywood that this movie was even made ',\n  'having just recently re viewed  lipstick  for the first time in a few decades  i backed it with  descent  even though i have heard more negative comments than good from other film friends with tastes as varied as mine  br    br   it s interesting to contrast how the unique niche of the rape revenge movie has evolved in the past 32 years  from the full on gore of  i spit on your grave   to the tawdry sensationalism of  lipstick   to the tasteful handling of the issue in  the accused   but  descent   though making some important points  never really offers us anything truly new in terms of revelatory meaning  no   descent  is so poorly made in terms of picture and sound quality that it detracts from any significant message it could hope to make     a message that  when examined closely  isn t that groundbreaking  br    br   i pretty much knew the plot going in  what i wanted to see  was  the  descent  or degeneration of dawson s character  being a big fan of rosario s  i was anxious to see the layers being stripped away and her psyche being slowly twisted   you know  the kind of portrayal deniro brings to  taxi driver   unfortunately  the script and the director writer s choices don t provide any sort of believable transition  br    br   the biggest point of failure is the second act  it became obvious what the filmmaker s intentions were for this segment of club hopping  drug use  and obsession with big black stallion adrian  every white boy s nightmare  natch  from a q a on the dvd  but this excursion into dawson s character is never believably rendered  we don t know exactly what the hell she s doing half the time  what she s after  or why she s doing it  the poor quality of the audio video again don t help  but the sequence is just too damn long and pointless  it destroys any momentum and investment in the lead character set up during the otherwise exceptionally well done first act  by the time we get to the finale  our interest has already waned  br    br   one point of success that dawson does point out in the q a is that by the end  revenge  scene we are pumped for retribution  then realize just how drawn out and ugly the reality is  while that s certainly valid  it doesn t make the scene any more intriguing  br    br   if you have the dvd  check out the deleted  classroom  scene  this is an excellent 8 minute plus outtake that crackles with energy and provocation  though all verbal  and really does show dawson s slow crack up materializing as she delightfully vivisects poor francie swift s prissy  condescending dorm counselor  if more expository scenes like this had been added and more of the middle third cut down  we might have an interesting psychological study of the impact of senseless acts of violence  br    br   as the film stands in the final cut  though  all we get is what we ve seen before  only in a more graphic rendering  so what ',\n  'revenge is one of my favorite themes in film  moreso   the futility of revenge  is one of my favorite themes in film  having seen gaspar noe s irreversible  2002   i was expecting an even more relevant expression of this theme  instead  this film is a weak half hearted attempt which expressed nothing but the film s lack of conviction and focus  br    br    spoilers  the end scene  a gratuitous male on male rape torture scene  came across as nothing less than a female revenge rape fantasy  however  the film doesn t even follow through with this  instead  the drawn out scene  which far exceeds the brutality of the initial rape both in the degree to which it was graphic and to which it was ritualized  is crowned with a shot of dawson s face in an expression of either regret or  this didn t fix anything  while the rape of her rapist is heard continuing in the background  br    br   my problem with the scene wasn t one of shock  but one of confusion as to what such a graphic scene was trying to get across to the audience  i mean  do we feel bad for the rapist  do we rejoice in dawson s revenge  are we disgusted by the brutality of it all  do we feel dawson s moment of regretful clarity  aside from this failing  the film is really sort of awkwardly paced with more style than substance  character s are thin  dialog is monotonous  etc  br    br   normally i try to take films on their own terms but descent didn t really seem to know what those were  thumbs down ',\n  'rosario dawson stars as a girl who is date raped and then begins a decent into darkness until given a chance at revenge  while its clear why dawson took the role  its a chance to show her acting chops and to make a small independent  decidedly un hollywood film  its also clear that aside from stunning good looks  dawson seems out of place in the role  forgive me i simply couldn t find her  thats not a mistake  thats how i felt  i had no idea where she was  yes i know she s on the screen but even though i spent the better part of two hours looking at her she left no impression on me whats so ever  i blame the script for this since other than the ending  not a whole heck of a lot that happened on screen seemed to make any real sense  the people seemed to be more posture than real and what happens didn t seem to fit together  forgive me for being vague but nothing in this film  other than the end  which i would love to talk about but can t cause it would spoil it   and the image of rosario dawson as nothing more than an image  stayed with me what can i say  this may click with you  it may not  for me it s time i can t get back  for rosario dawson fans only  though be warned there s several real reasons why this is nc17   and rosario  please  you re a better actress  pick better scripts ',\n  'this movie sucked plain and simple  okay so it s basically about a girl that gets raped  and to get revenge she gets another guy to rape the rapist  the rapist is a douche  but the girl victim is partly to blame  i mean they both get in the mood and start kissing and stuff  but when the rapist tries to have sex with her  she doesn t allow it so the rapist rapes her  and the thing is the rape scene for the girl is very short and it doesn t really expose or show anything  but when it comes to the rapist getting raped  it s a pretty long rape scene  there is basically nothing in the story that is worth watching  br    br   3 2 10',\n  'i m going to write about this movie and about  irreversible   the  in famous scene in it   so you are warned  if you haven t seen the movie yet  this are just my thoughts  why i think the movie fails  in the end   pun intended   br    br   acting wise  rosario dawson is really good and almost conveys portraying someone almost a decade younger  a teenager in other words   the villain guy is good  but loses his  evil  touch right before the end  if he really never changes  then why would he let a woman tie him up  he wouldn t  period  then we also have the bartender 2nd rape dude  actually i don t think you would need him  at least not for the 2nd rape  but more about that later on  br    br   let s reprise the story  rosarios character is sexually insecure  might even have lesbian tendencies  see her scene with a female friend   this wasn t intentional  as rosario states herself  but there is sexual tension between them  rosario s character meets a guy  who is a sexual predator  in all the bad senses  but he makes an impression on her  br    br   rosario commented that her character had a boyfriend before  i beg to differ  because she acts  as if it is her first boyfriend  which also underlines her phone conversation with her mother  talking about her mother  here s another problem  after the first rape takes place  rosarios character doesn t tell anyone what happened  seiing that her relationship with her mother is a very close one  nothing of that gets explored after that  if rosarios character wouldn t call her mother anymore or would behave strangely  the mother would be worried like crazy  there was so much potential here  also her female friend  we see her at the party  it s obvious there is something going on and  boom  she is gone  br    br   the first rape is almost unbearable to watch  but feels like a pinch  when you compare it to the ending  rape   which feels like you re getting hit with a sledge hammer  after rape no  1 we get too stretched out scenes  threads are opened  such as her construction work is an indication that she might be lesbian  as one guy states who tried to hit on her       but left in the open  no real social contact is established  if you leave the bartender guy out  who is involved in the 2nd and last rape scene  it s apparent that he isn t a  nice  guy and his character get s fleshed out a bit  but when rosarios character meets her rapist in class again  his being in the movie seems pointless  we get the point that rosarios character isn t the same anymore  that she went  bad  and is able to hurt people   too  many scenes show exactly that  her being without emotion just doing drugs and other stuff  back to rapist  1 who cheats on a test  gets caught by rosarios character and they decide to hang out together again  really    as absurd as that sounds  the guy meets up with her  not without us having seen him beforehand  with another girl  very likely that he raped her too  although we never see anything of that  fortunately  and his football career  well career is a stretch and he is bullied  this is an attempt to give his character some depth and it almost works  but then again is too cliché to stay with you  so rapist  1 submits to rosarios character     why exactly  because he promised her  it was her day  again  really  a guy like that never loses control  especially with a woman he raped before     i guess this is supposed to show us how stupid he is  the bartender guy would have worked as someone who could have hit him over the head or something  but letting him submit like that  just feels wrong  another possibility would have a drug in his drink  br    br   so rapist  1 undresses and get s blindfolded and let s rosarios character tie him on a bed      seriously  that s just crazy  but what comes next  is even crazier  first she talks to him  then she  shuts  him up and forces an object into him  this is as difficult to watch as rape scene number one  this isn t about what this guy deserves or not  it s just intense  and of course that was what they were aiming for  now after she is  done  the bartender guy comes in and rapes     rapist  1  if this really should work as a revenge movie  it would have been better if rosarios character herself would have been doing all the  revenge   having a henchman doing the job  takes away everything that was built up  br    br   this isn t supposed to be entertaining enjoyable  it s a hard watch   it is art house  but the 10 minute  i didn t count   rape scene at the end  just smashes everything  rosarios character is more or less  only watching what happens  which brings me to the biggest disappointment  br    br   irreversible comparison   irreversible  had the rape scene  but the movie went on  even if it was back into time   rosario is looking into the camera in the end and says something about having to get over this  first  that comes a bit too late  that should see her say that after the initial rape  and secondly and most importantly  this is where the art house movie should ve come in  it is more interesting seeing were rosarios character would go after the second rape scene and how she would cope  with what she had done  but then again  she didn t actually physically do that much  see above      a broken character that the movie cuts off     br    br   good intentions  talia and rosario had worked before   but failing to convey most of the things  they set out to do  even if you can see what they meant  it has to be convincing  otherwise it doesn t work      not to mention the overlong rape scenes as they are    ',\n  'this movie was disgusting  their should be a warning that some sadistic nasty writer is attempting to make a name for herself before being held hostage for an hour and a half watching garbage  what is garbage  the misuse of peoples time  the misuse of energy  and the waste of whatever type of educational system that taught her how to read and write  talia you are a sick demented loser  your psychiatrist needs to prescribe stronger medications for your problem   br    br   the acting and plot gave me no choice but to fast forward through the middle of the garbage  i ended up at a scene that was uncalled for  if you want to learn how to shock people watch a larry clark movie  i lost all respect for the entire cast of this movie  no more support from me   how could actors or actresses sit on a set while such gross depictions of human behavior is manifested from the mind of a psycho  i feel sorry for all actors that took part in that scene  i think the devil now knows who the writer of this movie is  congratulations you won his attention ',\n  'if you want to watch a good film about how women can fight back against sexual assault  then this film is not the film that you want to watch  it was a social commentary about a woman who was victimized and fights back  spoiler  rosario dawson turns the tables on her assailant  instead of using the criminal justice system  the victim resorts to using vigilantism  she in essence nullifies the judicial system  the film  the accused  was a much better film because the victim uses the judicial system and wins  what the  descent  does is telling victims of assault that they should resort to violence  is victim any better that the accuser  no   ',\n  'do not waste your time or your money on this movie  my roommate rented it because she thought it was the other movie called descent  the flick about some travelers who get trapped in a cave   so  we decided to watch it anyways thinking it couldn t be that bad  it was  i can t believe this movie was actually produced and put out to the public  it was so horrible it was almost like an accident scene where you want to look away but you just can t make yourself  i honestly feel emotionally scarred  it went from being a semi low budget movie in which a college girl gets assaulted by a boy she s dating to an all out porno flick  and really not a good one  i went from hating the woman s rapist to almost feeling bad for him  almost  all in all  an awful movie that was definitely rated nc 17 for a reason  don t waste your money  and don t let your kids watch it ',\n  'okay so i found out about this movie and i watched the preview read almost all the reviews and was having a hard time debating whether i should watch it or not  before i even watched the movie i was emotionally weird on it  i was so unsure if i was going to watch this and be disturbed for like a long time  so i choose to risk it and watched it and heres what i thought  the beginning started off fine for me  it seemed to be heading in a decent direction  got past the rape scene and i couldn t figure why people were so disturbed or bored by the movie  don t get me wrong the rape scene was just as sad and scary but it didn t really bother me to a dramatic point  then as the middle came in i understood the boring stuff that was going on  there was like 5 minutes shots of nothing but people walking around saying or showing nothing  its one thing to have a shot where a person is showing some kind of emotion but this movie didn t have that  it had about 3 of these pointless scenes  where you see the main character maya kind of get out of control but it didn t show it right making me want to fast forward  then when she engaged in the hardcore partying it wasn t so boring but still a little dull  oh and as a note rosario dawson still did a great job  okay moving on so finally after an hour of pointlessness to the middle the revenge comes to maya s attention  thats where it got disturbing  i didn t feel bad for him or nothing he got what he deserved but the whole scene was really disturbing and i just felt all eck after it  i cant really tell you whether or not to watch this movie because its so   i don t know i cant find a word to sum it up  but if you choose to watch it just don t be unsuprised ',\n  'this movie offers nothing to anyone  it doesn t succeed on any level  the acting is horrible  dull long winded dribble  they obviously by the length of the end sex scene were trying to be shocking but just ended up being pretty much a parody of what the film was aiming for  complete garbage  i can t believe what a laughable movie this was   br    br   and i m very sure rosario dawson ended up in this film cause she though this would be her jarring break away indi hit  a wowing nc 17 movie  the problem is no adult is going to stick with this film as the film plays out like a uninteresting episode of the oc or something aimed at teens  pathetic ',\n  'you know all those letters to  father christmas  and  jesus  that are sent every year  well  it turns out that they are not actually delivered but dropped off in a half forgotten corner of the post office to rot unless some bright spark figures out a way of posting them  as bizarre settings go  it s a winner and one which perfectly fits the strange movie that is  dead letter office   having said that  this is obviously an australian film as opposed to a british one  if it was royal mail  most letters get this sort of treatment anyway  i haven t been in this flat for two years and we re still getting letters for a mr wang  some female priest of the church of latter day i ve never heard of you and various catalogues for industrial equipment addressed to a plumbing company  br    br    dead letter office   the name given to the place where undeliverable mail ends up  follows the story of alice  miranda otto  who grows up in a seriously divided home  writing to her absent father  she only learns in adulthood that her letters haven t been delivered for one reason or another  so  logically  she gets a job at the d l o  and finds herself working alongside other social rejects including the brooding chilean immigrant frank lopez  george del hoyo   slowly  she finds herself drawn to him but can she find out where her dad is without bringing the self contained world of the dead letters office to its knees  br    br   nothing against this film but i was reminded of the god awful heather graham film  committed  while watching this  however  this is so much better than that pile of horse crap but then again  that ain t difficult  for a start  this film is much more logical  true  the metaphors are somewhat blatant and the underflowing symbolism quickly becomes a flood  but at least this is cohesive and quirky without being complete drivel  it is also well acted  both otto and del hoyo are very good as the lovers looking for something they know they ll never find while other characters are peripheral at best  part of the trouble is that it seems to wrap up far too quickly  leaving this viewer somewhat disappointed  the other part is that when you consider australia s draconian immigration policy  i e  if you don t speak english  rack off    such a story is unlikely to take place in reality  the other characters  sadly  also help to destabilise the realism by proving to be little more than odd ball stereotypes  br    br   despite that   dead letter office  is certainly something a little different  it might not be to everyone s taste but i liked it  yes  it was hackneyed and predictable but sometimes  it s nice to watch a film without guns or violence or heavy duty swearing and nudity  no chance of that in an australian film   there ain t any major laughs  there s no bullet time and the characters are usually one dimensional  but it s the story that counts here and while it s not earth shattering in its magnificence  it s a pleasant enough way of passing the time  it s the movie equivalent of a sheryl crow cd   nice to listen to now and again but you wouldn t really miss it if it wasn t there ',\n  'this movie had a imdb rating of 8 1 so i expected much more from it  it starts out funny and endearing with an energy that feels spontaneous  but before the movie is half way through  it begins to drag and everything becomes sickingly predictable  the characters in the office were delightful in the first third of the movie  but we get to know them a little too well  they become caricatures  not real people at all  this is the same story i ve seen hundreds of times  only told here with slightly different circumstances  the thing is  i could stomach another predictable love story if only the dialog weren t so stale  br    br   the only thing that could be worse is if the characters had inconsistent and unbelievable motivations  and unfortunately that was also the case with dead letter office  hopefully this movie will end up in the dead movie office soon ',\n  ' dead letter office  is a low budget film about a couple of employees of the australian postal service  struggling to rebuild their damaged lives  unfortunately  the acting is poor and the links between the characters  past misfortunes and present mindsets are clumsily and over schematically represented  what s most disappointing of all  however  is the portrayal is life in the office of the film s title  there s no mechanisation whatsoever  and it s quite impossible to ascertain what any of the staff really do for a living  granted  part of the plot is that the office is threatened with closure  but this sort of office surely closed in the 1930s  if it ever truly existed  it s a shame  as the film s overall tone is poignant and wry  and there s some promise in the scenario  but few of the details convince  overall  it feels the work of someone who hasn t actually experienced much of real life  a student film  with a concept and an outline  but sadly little else ',\n  'this picture seemed way to slanted  it s almost as bad as the drum beating of the right wing kooks who say everything is rosy in iraq  it paints a picture so unredeemable that i can t help but wonder about it s legitimacy and bias  also it seemed to meander from being about the murderous carnage of our troops to the lack of health care in the states for ptsd  to me the subject matter seemed confused  it only cared about portraying the military in a bad light  as a  an organzation that uses mind control to turn ordinary peace loving civilians into baby killers and b  an organization that once having used and spent the bodies of it s soldiers then discards them to the despotic bureacracy of the v a  this is a legitimate argument  but felt off topic for me  almost like a movie in and of itself  i felt that  the war tapes  and  blood of my brother  were much more fair and let the viewer draw some conclusions of their own rather than be beaten over the head with the film makers viewpoint  f ',\n  'when marlene dietrich was labeled box office poison in 1938 one of a handful of actresses so named by the trades papers  it was films like the garden of allah  how a film could be so breathtakingly beautiful to behold and be so insipidly dull is beyond me  also how marlene if she was trying to expand her range and not play a sexpot got stuck with such an old fashioned story is beyond me  br    br   the garden of allah  one of the very first films in modern technicolor was a novel set at the turn of the last century by robert hitchens who then collaborated on a play adaption with mary anderson that ran for 241 performances in 1911 12  it then got two silent screen adaptions  the story is about a monk who runs away from the monastery out in french tunisia to see some of what he s missed in the world  he runs into a similarly sheltered woman who was unmarried and spent her prime years caring for a sick parent  she s traveling now in the desert and the two meet on a train  br    br   the woman is of course marlene and the runaway monk is charles boyer  i m not sure what was in david o  selznick s mind in filming this story  someone like ingrid bergman might have made it palatable for the audience  but you can bet that the movie going public of 1936 when they plunked their money down for a ticket they expected to see marlene as a modern day salome rather than a saint with that title  the public still remembered rudolph valentino and you can bet that it was some desert romance and seduction that they were expecting  br    br   as for the monks you have to remember that they are self supporting in their monasteries and this particular one bottles a special wine of which boyer happens to be the one with the secret  the monastery will have to rethink it s economics if boyer leaves  the monks are a sincerely pious group  but from the head man charles waldron on down they ve a right to be a little concerned with some self interest  br    br   anyway a whole lot of religious platitudes get said here by a pair of leads that really are not suited for the parts  most especially marlene dietrich  i would watch this film with an eye for the special color desert cinematography and forget the plot ',\n  'the real star of this ridiculous story is glorious technicolor  a visual treat to the eye  the film fails to stimulate the mind and heart  i was intrigued  at first  by the idea of dietrich and boyer leaving religion in order to  find  their capacity for love  what follows is a huge disappointment  boyer is the only real actor in the production and one feels his torment  dietrich s amazing wardrobe outshines her performance    at times her face is frightening to look at    a unfeeling mask  as a monk  boyer held the formula for the monastery s liquer  which reminds me of the true story of chartreuse     when he leaves his  marriage to god  the reaction by his fellow monks holds the shock and fear that perpetuate organized religion  the viewer feels boyer was well rid of his past  however  the journey that follows is all too predictable ',\n  'as a great admirer of marlene dietrich  i had to  finally  watch this very  very dull picture  it is miss dietrich s first color film  and the world s most beautiful blond is a redhead  bad start  the story is a tremendous bore  involving a subject which itself bores bores me stiff  religious guilt   who needs it     suffice it to say  perhaps  that of all dietrich s films  and i have seen most  including  pittsburgh   this is the only one where even her performance is barely worth watching  the color photography is ok  this is a very early technicolor release   but to no purpose  ridiculous casting  c  aubrey smith  basil rathbone  enough said    the only thing of any interest at all is john carradine s outlandish caricature of a performance as  the sand diviner   who foretells all that will happen  the supposed  happy ending  is one of the most depressing ever conceived  yet another example of david o  selznick s highly inflated reputation  did he ever make a really good film     other than that one   and  for one final annoyance  the soundtrack of the mgm

move  put in player  hide in blankets   and though i tried to understand what was happening to lead to the ending that will be eternally ruined by pop culture  it just really didn t make it  everything was all over the place  relationships had no backbone  the ending had no lead in  everything was just kind of there in some freakish way and the watcher has no choice but to leave partially dumbfounded at the ending that it gets to  because even though we all know that it s people  it s quick answers as to why it s people makes any serious attempt at enjoying the movie for anything other

one of the biggest  yet most forgotten films but the impact of its setting is becoming more a reality with each passing day  charlton heston overdramatizes his role  yet it works  edward g  robinson

is not a mystery if you do research on the movie  soylent is enjoyable to watch  but the whole screenplay is a joke  it is just as cheap as the entire production  the screenplay and the over dramatics of the actors made the movie  yet were completely hilarious  everyone seems to be a moron and no one knows the rules  specifically cop thorn who likes to just waltz into people  s apartments  peruse around shamelessly and steal anything he wants  the character  s interactions keeps your attention on the movie  but still you realize that soylent green sucks  an enjoyable piece if you have the time

any kind of shape or form  rambo is more my kind of movie  action  kills  blood  horror  if you recognize yourself in this avoid this movie like the plague  no one dies  no action  no nudity  nothing of the kind  let me give you a résumé in a few sentences  it starts out with 5 minutes in black and white nazi propaganda  every italian in a housing block attends a parade in honor of hitler  except for a housewife  an anti fascist and a caretaker  the housewife who is cheated by her husband  meets the anti fascist  she falls in love with him  wants to make love to him  but the anti fascist is gay  despite of this they make love with each other  at the end of the day  the housewife reads a book from her gay lover  and the guy himself is deported by agents  the end  you want an even shorter résumé  boring    that short enough  the guy should have used his gun in the beginning of this movie and shoot himself  to save the audience from this atrocity  on a side note my sister loved this movie  like i said  i m a cultural barbarian   ',\n  ' fever pitch  isn t a bad film  it s a terrible film  br    br   is it possible american movie audiences and critics are so numbed and lobotomized by the excrement that hollywood churns out that they ll praise to the skies even a mediocre film with barely any laughs  that s the only reason i can think of why this horrible romantic comedy  and i use that term loosely because there s nothing funny in this film  is getting good reviews  br    br   i sat through this film stunned that screenwriters lowell ganz and babaloo mandel would even for an instant think their script was funny  br    br   the brilliant nick hornby usually translates well to film  he adapted  fever pitch  for a british film starring colin firth and ruth gemmell in 1997  peter hedges found hornby s voice for  about a boy   2002  and when  high fidelity  was americanized for a movie in 2000  writers d v  devincentis  steve pink  john cusack and scott rosenberg didn t go wrong because they kept the essence of hornby s wit and humor  they made one of the best films of that year  br    br   so why does the american version of  fever pitch  go so painfully awry  the british version wasn t a masterpiece  but it was charming  funny  unexpected and gave us two characters we could like  respect and understand  br    br   but ganz and mandel have excised everything funny in hornby s work  in americanizing the story  they ve butchered it  removing all that was good and unique about hornby s work and replacing it with conventional drivel  br    br   they ve transformed a funny story into a formulaic romantic comedy  never once veering from the wretched formula  lindsey  drew barrymore  has three girlfriends  each of whom has a distinct function  one s overweight  the second s cynical and ambitious  and the third s a romantic  want to guess how many male friends ben  jimmy fallon  has  br    br   what made  high fidelity  such fun was not only a good leading man and lady  but engaging supporting characters  in this  fever pitch   the six supporting friends do or say nothing especially funny  they re so insignificant  they re not even decorative  the only reason they re in the film is because the formula demands it  poor ione skye winds up as one lindsey s pals in a thankless role  the lovely skye must have been wishing lloyd dobler would swoop in and take her away  come to think of it  cusack would ve made an excellent ben  of course  cusack is too smart to attach himself to such an utterly tedious script  br    br   there isn t a single  solitary moment in this film that seems original or unforced  every plot turn is predictable  every lame joke telegraphed  ganz and mandel labor for laughs  the first 45 minutes are so excruciatingly slow  you wonder if these chaps realized they were writing a comedy  you can mark the plot turns in this film by your watch  it s almost as if ganz and mandel penned this with some screen writing guru s formula pasted on the wall  when they got to a certain page  they looked up at the formula and said   ok  the guru says this has to happen now   and  presto  br    br   directors bobby and peter farrelly don t help the film any  they have no concept how to introduce their story and characters  they hand over the v o  narration not to the protagonist  but to another guy who sits behind ben at fenway park   thanks to some extremely clunky writing  we have to watch barrymore and fallon stumble through their unfunny initial meetings  br    br   barrymore does cute and adorable better than most  she s as good at it as goldie hawn in her heyday  but even her cuteness can t save this extraordinarily awful film  she tries hard to wring some energy and humor out of this story  about 30 minutes into the film  lindsey tells ben   you re funny   the only explanation for her remark is that it was in the script  for fallon s ben never says anything even remotely funny  fallon is neither witty nor funny  when he does comedy  he overacts  br    br   fallon was never any good on  saturday night live   he was quite possibly the least funny person on that show  remember that lame sketch about a radio dj who did all the voices  the only reason  weekend update  worked occasionally was because fallon s cohort  tina fey  knows a thing or two about comedy  br    br   actors who think they re funny and behave that way rarely  if ever  are actually funny  that s true of fallon  he thinks he s hysterically funny when he barely raises a chuckle  his stuttering  unsure of himself shtick didn t work on the small screen  it s lousier on the big screen  br    br   unfortunately for fallon  his role in this picture also requires a few dramatic moments  if you thought his comedy was bad  wait till you get a load of his dramatic stuff  two scenes in particular   the first in a park  the second in front of ben s school   are painful to watch  the scenes require an actor with a smidgen of dramatic ability  but fallon has neither the knowledge nor the ability to make them work  his range of emotions doesn t even run the gamut from a to b  br    br   ben has no personality or depth  often  he comes across as an oaf  and not a lovable one at that  it boggles the mind what lindsey would find attractive about him  compare fallon s performance to firth s in the british version  and you ll understand how terribly flat  unfunny and forced fallon s ben is and how wrong he is for this role  watching fallon in  fever pitch  makes one long for the dramatic depth and comedic nuance of ashton kutcher  br    br   just as  high fidelity  did  an americanized  fever pitch  could ve worked brilliantly  it just needed better writers  more competent directors and  most definitely  a stronger  funnier  smarter leading man  do yourself a huge favor  avoid this rotten film  rent the 1997 british version and read hornby s book  instead ',\n  'i am generally more willing to be open minded about rom coms than many  but this was simply not a very good attempt  its got nothing to do with comparisons with the british original    have not seen  and doubt i will  it has a whole lot to do with a meandering plot  lack of chemistry between the leads and a godawful performance character from its supposed male lead  jimmy fallon   br    br   fallon walks onto the screen wearing the clothes and hairdo of a 15 year old and acting a decade younger than that  he s supposed to be a teacher you see  and of course its well known that school districts the world over love to hire individuals less mature than the children they purport to teach  the character is so extremely disturbed and irrational that i have my doubts whether any actor could have made him likable  but old reliables like john cusack or adam sandler might have been able to give it a shot  not fallon  who is neither funny  nor an actor  but appears to think he is both  not once in the entire course of the movie do you either believe fallon in his role  or believe that there is any way these two people should  or would be together  near the end of the movie there is a scene where barrymore  who was cute as usual but could not carry this one alone    its hard to have a one person romance  tells fallon that its over  too much has happened  and she s moving on  and rather than feeling bad about the scene  or sorry for fallon  you are actively cheering her on    finally she does what she should have done months ago  but of course the plot mechanics won t allow that to be the end of it  an end which actually might have made a statement out of this mess   and instead we get to see the rational career girl throwing it all away to chase after this childish idiot and encourage his delusions  its of course meant to be gooey and satisfying  but it actually made me more disgusted than anything else ',\n  'i saw this director s  woman on the beach  and could not understand the good to great reviews  this film is much like that one  two people who are caught in a relationship with very little dynamic and even less interest to anyone else  like his other films  you have to want to listen to vacuous dialog  wade through very little and become enchanted with underwritten  pretty uninteresting characters  if you feel you can like this film  don t let my review stop you  i do like minimalism in films  but i feel tsai ming liang s films are far superior  he has a fairly terrific actor in lee kang sheng in his films  there is nothing here  i wish iu liked it  but i don t  oh  well ',\n  'this movie sounded like it might be entertaining and interesting from its description  but to me it was a bit of a let down  very slow and hard to follow and see what was happening  it was as if the filmmaker took individual pieces of film and threw them in the air and had them spliced together whichever way they landed  definitely not in sequential order   also  nothing of any consequence was being filmed  i have viewed quite a few different korean films and have noticed that a good portion are well made and require some thinking on the viewer s part  which is different from the typical hollywood film  but this one befuddled me to no end  i viewed the film a second and third time and it still didn t do anything for me  i still don t really understand what the filmmaker was trying to convey  if it was to just show a typical mundane portion of a person s life  i guess he succeeded  but i was looking for more  needless to say  i can t recommend this movie to anyone ',\n  'this typically melodramatic bollywood film has inexplicably become a favorite of western critics  the script is ludicrous  the acting is over the top  and it looks cheesy  the only reasons for watching this soap opera are the wonderful songs sung by mangeshkar and the curtain call of the legendary meena kumari  watching the actress  who was ill during the filming and would drink herself to death at age 40 shortly after the film was released  has the same fascination as watching a train wreck  her ex husband  amrohi  wrote and directed  but lacks the competency to execute either task well  bollywood has produced far better films ',\n  'this was a disappointing horror film about a snotty young girl and her nightmares  for a horror or  thriller  film and hype  it s way too tame  there are only a few tense moments in here  not anywhere as near as many as should have been for a film of this genre  even those  tense  scenes weren t much  the music made them more dramatic that they actually were  br    br   there is a lot of symbolism in here  so the elitist critics label this  a thinking person s horror film   well  if they think about it  i m sure they will come to the same conclusion i did   a waste of money at the video rental store  br    br   summary  a yawner that offers an unlikeable lead character and generally poor acting  vastly overrated and certainly not what it is advertised ',\n  'after reading some very good reviews about this film i thought i would give it a watch and after being very disappointed with the film i thought i would give it my own review  this is my first ever so bare with me  br    br   first of all i would scratch horror from the genre as in no way is it horrific or scary in the slightest  with the exception of a few feeble attempts to make you jump unfortunately one of which worked on me   i would say that calling this film a thriller is pushing it as i wasn t particularly thrilled either  the film is about a spoiled mischievous girl who faints a few times  during these times she visits a house which she has been drawing  after each visit she decides to add something else to the house to make it a bit more lively one of the features being a sad little boy who is also ill in reality  as she befriends the boy she realises that her imaginary world that she created is actually better than the real world that she is in  until she adds her constantly away father to the house  due to a misdrawing her dad turns out to be evil and her and the boy must escape from his clutches  br    br   think its an attempt to be a slightly more mellow version of a nightmare on elm street but is more like a trip to the beach  br    br   in conclusion my generous 3 10 will hopefully stop at least one of you from watching this drab ',\n  'normally i m not the sort to be scared by horror movies  but this movie is the exception  some how this movie got into my mind    it is a very simple movie but at the same time extremelly effective  it has great atmosphere and this leads to some shocking moments  the girls father coming down the hill is a real standout  another seen was the family photo i wasn t expecting that and i jumped out my seat    i would recommend everyone to see this movie  with the lights out it will stay with you for a long time     ',\n  'i was rooting for this film as it s a remake of a 1970s children s tv series  escape into night  which  though chaotic and stilted at times was definitely odd  fascinating and disturbing  the acting in  paperhouse  is wooden  unintentionally a joke  the overdubs didn t add tension they only reinforced that i was sat watching a botch  casting exasperated the dreary dialogue which resulted in relationships lacking warmth  chemistry or conviction  as in most lacklustre films there are a few good supporting acts these people should be comforted  consoled and reassured that they will not be held responsible  out of all the possible endings the most unexpected was chosen     lamer than i could have dreamt  br    br    escape into night  deserves a proper remake  written by someone with life experience and directed with a subtle mind ',\n  'an intriguing premise of hand drawn fantasy come to life in a child s fever dreams  however  i imagine the average nonfictional child is far more adept at scaring themselves than bernard rose is at riveting the viewer  the duel between anna s two realities drags on far too long to sustain interest  especially considering that the little girl playing her is the most abrasive child actor i ve ever seen  br    br   use only for kindling ',\n  'in 1988  paperhouse was hailed as a  thinking man s horror film   wow  you might say  sign me up  this thing is a mess  it

even be pretentious   something interesting  it seems like the producers were on lithium  br    br   even in the dream world things are boring  br    br   a short no on this one ',\n  'films starring child actors put themselves on the back foot from the very beginning  while there are some exceptions  the majority of kids just cant act and even the ones that can normally become annoying after a few minutes  the kids in paperhouse have managed to capture the worst of both worlds  as they re both very annoying and they don t have an ounce of acting ability between them  in short  they re rubbish  this isn t good considering that they re the leads  and it especially isn t good when you consider the fact that it is virtually impossible to take this film seriously because of the rubbish actors  it s a shame that this film is such a dead loss as the plot isn t  not completely   it follows a young girl who  after drawing a picture of a house in her notebook  wakes up in the fantasy world that she has created  it soon becomes apparent to her that she can manipulate this world through her drawings  and so sets about making various changes  until her dream eventually becomes a nightmare  oh dear  br    br   as you can see  this plot line gives a nice base for a good fantasy horror movie  however  it is squandered through a number of fatal faults  first and foremost  in spite of the premise being an excellent premise for lots of inventiveness  the movie is extremely stale  the central plot is hardly played with at all  and the result is an entirely boring experience  the lack of tension is another huge gaping flaw in the movie  as it sees fit to drag every sequence out to a point that you just don t care any more  which is due to a lack of ideas   thanks in part to it s lead characters  the film feels like a kids movie throughout  this is to be expected as it stars kids  but bernard rose should have decided the slant that he wanted to put on the story  as the horror in the movie is laughable at best  the film is also very cheesy  and the  romance  between the two leads is extremely cringe worthy  and makes for very painful viewing  in fact  if i had to sum this travesty up in one word  i would choose  painful   paperhouse is poorly acted  laughably plotted  very corny and dull on the whole  save yourself the pain  see something else ',\n  'first i liked that movie  it seemed to me a nice comedy with some silly moments  the costume designer albert wolsky did his best    the same as wonderful set decorator robert r  benton   this man really had a very good taste    but the script writers disappointed me extremely  the best ending would be the scene on the ladder  but instead of it  they decided that the father and his daughter should be together  don t like the ending  the father becomes boyfriend of his own daughter and his ex wife knows about it and finds it alright  it would be ok  if the scriptwriters would for example say that now there is a different soul in the body  but they did not  they only deprived him of memories  the actors were good  they were really funny  cybill shepherd was charming  robert downey jr  was very funny in the dancing scene          but some of the moments spoil even the impression of good acting  for example  corinne jeffries  played by cybill shepherd after the death of her husband was waiting for him 23 years  it s a long time    she was true to him  she loved nobody but him  and when she met him and was just about making love to him  after a scene with her friend philip train  ryan o neal   she very easily betrayed the man she was longing for so many years    it would be a good movie  if not the ending and some missed human psychology ',\n  'predictable plot  simple dialogue  shockingly unemotional performances  but robert downey  jr  is so cute  i gave this  poor man s afternoon special  a 3 instead of the 1 or 2 it so richly deserved ',\n  ' chances are  a big mistake to see  you

version of it as well  but at least it was an outright remake  so  so sad  i very much enjoy watching filipino movies and know some great things can come out of such a little country  so i can t believe this had to happen  claudine and kris are such big names there  surprised they would be affiliated with plagiarism  to any aspiring movie makers out there in the philippines  you do not have to stoop this low to make money  there are many movie buffs that are watching the movies filipinos put out and enjoying them ',\n  'i would have given this movie a 1 out of 10 if it weren t for ms  claudine barretto s performance  and i will take this time to overlook that kris aquino s here  and    end  br    br   i really avoid watching pinoy horror movies because stories lack originality and i really think that  some  writers don t give enough attention to the characters  and their progression  in their stories  redundant     it was as if they  pushed  the movie onwards when their storytelling stank  and my goodness  creative exhaustion led them to rip off other movies  why   why did this movie get a good review   i wouldn t give it that much merit  the movie was kind of scary  but the movie seemed more freaky as it deals with filipino folklore    it goes into my list of  most likely to happen  category  i just wished they spent more time improving the story lines and fix those flash back sequences  never mind if the lighting sucked  it wouldn t matter much if the content would blow you away   sayang ',\n  'how did this become a blockbuster  dear god i don t know where to start why this movie sucked too much  the movie was predictable   there was no originality  the only thing i can admire is the acting of some characters  the movie was too bright  they should have done something with the lighting  eg  making the environment more darker  the make up on certain dead characters made this movie look like a 1970 horror flick  this is 2006  people don t get scared by other people wearing heavy make up  most of the horror scenes we re taken from other hollywood or asian horror movies  total rip off  this is why i don t watch tagalog movies  the only reason why so many people  screamed  while watching this movie is because of conformity  how many times do we have to copy scenes from the ring and improvise it that instead of the girl coming out of the tv  its now coming from the window next door  no matter how you put it  its still a rip off  if you want a good horror movie  go watch the 50 best horror movie listed on this website ',\n  'so  i got a hold of this as an assignment for trent harris  who teaches occasionally in the film dept at the u of u  i guess this is his only real way to get anyone to see his film    br    br   the documentary section at the beginning dragged on  yes  the kid is a nut job from no where  but that s not good enough to keep it interesting  br    br   seeing sean penn dressed as a onj is the only highlight    and after about thirty seconds it loses all humor  br    br   when crispin glover takes on larry  the story telling was better  but i just couldn t take anymore   ',\n  'it s amazing that this movie turns out to be in one of my hitlists after all  it is by far the number 1 worst movie i have ever seen  br    br   not only have i ever been this bored before  luckily not for more then 1 5 hours   the pre adolescent attempts at humor that feature it are not even close to getting but one of the corners of my mouth slightly tilted  after the first very awkward part  you tend to hope that the other parts will be at least slightly better  you hope in vain  it only goes downhill from there  br    br   the movie has no story worth telling whatsoever and repeats this non story three times  one can only hope that by some miracle all remaining copies of this movie are lost forever and trent harris never lays his hands on a camera again   ',\n  'i don t think any player in hollywood history lasted as long as david niven did given most of the weak films he had to carry by dint of his incredible charm  he could act  got an oscar for it  but most of the material he did was as light as one

as the film is set in edinburgh during their festival  but if you can recall a single song from it you must have a photographic memory  br    br   the plot is light  vera ellen is the american lead in a musical that apparently is getting its out of town tryout in edinburgh  she starts in the chorus and runs late one day  she gets a lift from the chauffeur of a millionaire greeting card king  everybody now assumes she s the main squeeze of the millionaire  doors open up as they ve never opened before  br    br   the millionaire is david niven and he goes along with it and the various situations that are engendered by the mistake  cesar romero has some good moments here as the frantic producer of this musical  br    br   in the end though happy go lovely is light and harmless fluff which david niven did so much of and got so tired of ',\n  'the oddly named vera ellen was to movie dancing what sonja henie was to movie ice skating  blonde  girlish  always delightful to watch  but not an especially good actress and usually lumbered with weak material  when i watch vera ellen s sexy apache dance with gene kelly in  words and music   i can t help noticing that her blouse  yellow with narrow red horizontal stripes  seems to be made out of the south vietnam flag  for some reason  the very american vera ellen starred in  two  musicals  made several years apart  set in edinburgh  a city not noted for its tap dancers   let s be happy  and  happy go lovely   br    br   in the latter  cesar romero plays an american impresario who for some reason is staging a musical in edinburgh  there s a vague attempt to link this show to the edinburgh festival  which is nonsense  the festival is not a showcase for splashy leg shows  we also see a couple of stock shots of the royal mile  apart from a few highland accents  there s absolutely no attempt to convey scottish atmosphere in this movie  the funniest gag occurs at the very beginning  when we learn that the title of romero s show is  frolics to you   this is a cheeky pun that britons will get and yanks won t  br    br   vera ellen is  as usual  cute and appealing and an impressive dancer  but the very few musical numbers in this movie are boring and bad  the plot    mistaken identity between magnate david niven and reporter gordon jackson    is brainless  though no more so than the plots of several dozen hollywood musicals  romero is less annoying than usual here  probably because  for once  he isn t required to convince us that he s interested in bedding the heroine  br    br   the single biggest offence of this movie is its misuse of bobby howes  the father of sally ann howes was a major star of west end stage musicals  his wistful rendition of  she s my lovely  was a big hit in britain in 1937  here  he shows up in several scenes as romero s dogsbody but never has a chance to participate in a musical number  nor even any real comedy  it s absolutely criminal that this movie    with a title containing the word  lovely   sure to evoke howes s greatest hit    would cast a major british musical star but give him nothing to do  br    br   the delightful character actress ambrosine phillpotts  whom i worked with once  shines in one restaurant sequence  and there s a glimpse of the doomed beauty kay kendall  as vera ellen s confidante  somebody named diane hart speaks in one of the most annoying voices i ve ever heard  it sounds like an attempt to imitate joan greenwood and glynis johns both at the same go  but doesn t match either  val guest has a story credit  but this movie doesn t come up to the quality of his brilliant comedies  the colour photography is wretched  though i realise that postwar britain could not afford hollywood s process work   happy go lovely  is at utmost best a pleasant time waster  with  waster  being the operative word  i ll rate this movie just 4 out of 10 ',\n  ' happy go lovely  has only two things going for it  and those two things are vera ellen s legs  this is a british  excelsior films  version of an m g m musical complete with second tier stars  i would imagine that vera ellen took this role thinking that it might finally propel her to the status of a major musical star  but  i m sorry to say  ms  ellen s chance did not pay off  br    br   opening with a horrible scottish number and stumbling thru awful dialog to the next dull tune  this movie seems very heavy handed and sloppy  the predictable mistaken identity plot is very thin  and with the exception of david niven  cesar romero  who is way over the top in his role of a producer  and bobby howes  who is totally wasted in a nothing role  the rest of the cast is totally forgettable  br    br   the choreography is boring  but ms  ellen gives it her all  she was never as famous as most of the other musical stars and she shouldn t be since she couldn t sing and even had a  dancing stand in  in several of her pictures   but when she did dance  it was just entrancing  br    br   it s too bad that this film that could have made her a star did not give her the tools she needed to shine  br    br   4 out of 10',\n  'happy go lovely is a waste of everybody s time and talent including the audience  the lightness of the old hat mistaken identity and faux scandal plot lines is eminently forgivable  very few people watched these movies for their plots  but  they usually had some interesting minor characters involved in subplots    not here  they usually had interesting choreography and breathtaking dancing and catchy songs  not happy go lovely  and vera ellen as the female lead played the whole movie as a second banana looking desperately for a star to play off it    and instead she was called upon to carry the movie  and couldn t do it  the scottish locale was wasted  usually automatically ubiquitous droll scottish whimsy is absent  the photography was pedestrian  the musical numbers were pedestrian  cesar romero gives his usual professional performance  chewing up the scenery since no one else was doing his part  in the type of producer role essayed frequently by walter abel and adolph menjou  david niven is just fine  and no one could do david niven like david niven  at the end of the day  if you adore niven as i do  it s reason enough to waste 90 minutes on happy go lovely  if not  skip it ',\n  '    may contain spoilers       br

prescription anti anxiety  anti depression  and anti psychotic medications  this is the classic psych ward combo that renders patients into drooling zombies  all during filming  then this movie would hold far more interest  or  if the film production was another type of experiment where all of the actors were sleep deprived before and during filming  then tokyo time could be more easily explained

to a light hearted films  like tampopo or chung king express  two of my favourites   so i thought i would like this  well  i would rather slit my wrists and drink my own blood than watch this laborious  badly acted film ever again  br    br   i think the director steven okazaki must have spiked the water with quaalude  because no one in this film had a personality  and when any of the characters did try to act  as opposed to mumbling a line or two  their performance came across as forced and incredibly fake  i honestly did not think that anyone had ever acted before   the only person who sounded genuine was brenda aoki   i find it amazing that this is promoted as a comedy  because i didn t laugh once  even more surprising is that cbs morning news called this  a refreshing breath of comedy   it was neither refreshing  nor a breath of comedy  and the ending was very predictable  the previous reviewer must be an idiot to think such things  br    br   avoid this film

jokes unfunny and it is painful to try and sit through even half an episode  furthermore the link between this show and the  70s  is extremely tenuous beyond the style of dress and the scenery and background used for the show  it seems to be nothing more than a modern sitcom with the same old unfunny  clichéd scripts that modern sitcoms have dressed up as depicting a show from twenty years ago in the hope that it will gain some nostalgic viewers or something like that  both  happy days  and  the wonder years  employ the same technique much more effectively and are actually a pleasure to watch in contrast to this horrible  pathetic excuse for a show',\n  'i ve tried to watch this show several times  but for a show called  that  70s show   i don t find much apart from a few haircuts and the occasional reference to disco that actually evokes the  70s    the decade in which i grew up  of the episodes i have seen  most of the plots and jokes could be set in any time period  take away the novelty of  supposedly  being set in the  70s  and the show is neither interesting nor funny  br    br   if you re looking for a show that more successfully represents the experience of youth in america in the  70s  in my humble opinion you can do no better than  the wonder years  ',\n  'as someone who lived through and still remembers that decade vividly if the actual  70s had been half this funny and  semi normal they would have been so much more enjoyable actual kids in that era did not act or behave anything close to as bright eyed and normal as these kids did the country s youth was still under the influence of the hippies and the drug culture all that  60s rebellion that it spawned especially in the behavior department the petulance the smugness the self righteousness the childishness the unreasonableness of them   none of the characters exhibit any of that  br    br   someone compared to  happy days  and i can see why they were both sitcoms that take place 20 years before the current time they were broadcast and they both offer only surface  cliched depictions of the actual eras not even close to the full scope of it just showing the obvious things   the fashions toys music contraptions etc and that s it for those too young to remember or weren t born then trust me the  70s weren t like that any more than  happy days  were like the actual  50s as  m a

the birds in the invisible maniac aren t even that good looking  the comedy is lame   every joke misses by the proverbial mile  this is the kind of film that thinks someone fighting an invisible man

best action movies they ve seen  or of the summer  year  etc   they say it s an excellent conclusion  wtf                what has been concluded  besides the fact that bourne can ride motorcycles  shoot  and fight better than anyone else he comes across   what do you learn about bourne s character in this movie         absolutely f       nothing        okay  there s a lot of action  but what s so great about the action in this movie   i don t like the cinematography and film editing  the shaky camera effect and fast changing shots were used too much and they get old fast  i didn t mind them in supremacy because it was still easy to follow and was not used in excess  and made me quite dizzy  i was quickly wishing i had saved my     for something else  br    br   this movie has no plot  all this movie is is a 115 minute chase seen  bourne  who you learn absolutely nothing about in the entire 115 minutes of the movie  is a perfectionist at everything he attempts  there is absolutely no character development in this movie  you know nothing about anyone  and there is a wide array of new characters that are introduced in this installment  some people said that this movie has incredible writing and suspense                      what writing     what suspense    there s no suspense  bourne is so perfect at doing everything he does  i don t think he has anything to worry about  if this is the best movie of the year 2007 i may just quit watching movies entirely      br    br   many people have also said that matt damon s performance in this movie is one of the best  if not the best  of his career  what performance   how many lines did he have in this movie    i have some respect for damon because he has been in movies that i liked and has played different kinds of characters  but a good actor is someone that you can barely recognize from one movie to the next  someone who chooses different types of roles  not someone who plays the same roles over and over again  which damon doesn t do  but an example of someone who does is vin diesel   br    br   anyways  this movie was a big disappointment to me  i do not recommend this movie but i do recommend the first two  bourne identity and bourne supremacy  and i most definitely recommend reading the three books  which are much different then the movies  ',\n  'users who have rated this movie so highly simply can t have seen enough good films to compare it with  have they all been brainwashed   i have rarely felt so disappointed by a film and some of that must be attributable to the ridiculous hype surrounding this movie  br    br   from the first  bu is just a chase film  we pick it up at the end of one chase and go straight into another  and another  and another  and another  do you see a pattern emerging  there is virtually no time  wasted  on plot  character development  or boring old reality  br    br   if you haven t see the other two bourne films  you re pretty lost  if you have   you only wish you were lost   somewhere a long way from a cinema  br    br   paul greengrass s dispassionate style worked exceptionally well on united 93 which was a sentiment overload desperate to happen  but on bourne and his interminable woes it just has the effect of removing the audience from involvement with the character  he runs  he jumps  he punches  he gets blown up  he clears tall buildings  yada yada yada  above all   he survives  he survives like a plastic action man survives  which only makes the ridiculous stunts he pulls all the more slack and lacking in any kind of tension  so he drives off a building  so what  he ll survive  yawn  br    br   there s a girl thrown into the mix because bourne s love interest died in a previous incarnation  but she s just decor  i ve seen more character depth and snappy dialogue in episodes of captain scarlet  br    br   bourne s own journey of literal self discovery is dull and formless and tells us nothing we didn t know from the first movie  he was turned into a killing machine  big deal  he finds out his true identity  so what  it doesn t have any emotional resonance when it comes  br    br   the  twist  ending is telegraphed and weak  oh  dear  the more i think about this film the more i hate it  i ve already reduced my score to 4 during the writing of this comment  i d better end now before the slide continues  br    br   i love a good action flick and i love a good thriller  the bourne ultimatum is neither  it s a loud  tedious series of flashy edits  ridiculous sound effects and cartoon violence   br    br   the idea that it  shows the way  to the bond franchise is utter crap  casino royale blows it out of the water ',\n  'macy  ullman and sutherland were as great as usual  ritter wasn t bad either  what s her name was as pretty as usual  it could have been a good movie  to bad the plot was atrocious  it was completely predictable  trite and boring  br    br   from the first 15 minutes  the rest of the movie was laid out like a child s paint by numbers routine  the characters were stock pieces of cut out cardboard  there was nothing new or interesting to say and that completely outweighed the acting  which was a pity  br    br   finally  too bad the script writer wasn t the victim  especially with the  precocious  lines from the child  which were completely unbelievable  br    br   again  it s only the acting that prevented a much lower score ',\n  'undeveloped unbelievable story line  by the time i sort of figured out where it was going  i no longer cared  bad casting  come on    william macy as a hit man     bad directing  have you ever seen tracey ullman perform so badly   was i supposed to care what happened to the unethical incompetent  uncaring john ritter character   bad script     really  i m not looking for a formula script but this was really awful  the only really good thing in it was the kid  ten lines  it s not ok if your comment is less than ten lines  come on   whose rules are those  why can t i say what i have to say in less than 10 lines    isn t that kind of arbitrary  why isn t it ok to have less than 10 lines of comment ',\n  'i watched this movie  and hoped for something to get better the entire time  what is so great about a guy with no emotion   yawn  br    br   you never see alex show emotion for anyone other than his son  yeah  i know that this is why his son is the only one to cause him to lose his temper  if you can call it that   i get it  br    br   characters are undeveloped  relationships aren t given enough time to be understood  in one scene sarah says they won t fall in love  and the next time we see her she s talking about how his death really shook her up because they were so close  logic synapses abound in this film  br    br   it s like someone watched boogie nights and wrote this part to mimic little bill  even the scene where he  loses his temper  is the same as when little bill shoots his wife  down to the facial expression  or lack thereof   yes  william h  macy is good at portraying a man without emotion   been there  done that   can you say magnolia  br    br   this movie didn t only lack emotion  it lacked substance  a good script  developed characters  and a plot  and it certainly lacks my recommendation     br    br    a ',\n  'i cannot believe this woodenly written and directed piece of cliche film got made  there are about four good looking shots  the director should think about switching to still photography  and that s it  a strong cast is utterly wasted  scenes repeatedly end at the least interesting moments and the script says nothing new  please spare yourself this movie ',\n  'some kids are hiking in the mountains  and one of them goes into a large tunnel and discovers some old mummified gladiator  he puts on the gladiator s helmet and spends the rest of the movie killing all the other hikers  br    br   this thing is just so utterly senseless it s maddening  here s a short list of things that don t make any sense  br    br   1  a guy and a girl are in their tent and they think they hear something outside  the guy goes out to investigate and finds another hiker outside  then he hears his girlfriend scream so they head back to the tent   arriving the next morning    he was only 50 feet away  br    br   2  these two dunderheads then hear another girl scream  what  100 feet away    but don t investigate because they re afraid they ll get lost  br    br   3  another guy and a girl are walking around  and in about their 10th scene together the girl informs the guy that due to the circumstances  protocol no longer requires him to address her as professor  i mean  what the     first off  that s just a really stupid thing to say  secondly he never called her professor in the first nine scenes they were in together  br    br   4  a wounded girl attacks demonicus and he stops her  telling her that part of his gladiator training taught him how to wound without killing  um  yeah  we kinda noticed she s wounded and not dead because she s up and walking around  but  thanks for that tidbit of information  br    br   5  one girl is tied up in demonicus  lair  and when someone attempts to free her  she instead instructs this person to go and get help  um  look  idiot  if she set you free  which would take about 5 seconds  there would be no need to get help  br    br   and it just goes on and on  the whole middle part of the movie is spent with the two idiots getting lost in the woods  then they fight  then they pitch a tent and ignore the screams of their friends  then they wander around some more  it s just so damned boring and pointless that i turned the dvd off halfway through   br    br   none of these characters are sympathetic  especially the ones that get the majority of the screen time  demonicus himself made me laugh out loud every time i saw him   he looks like a kid in a halloween costume  scrunching his face up to look evil  he runs  or should i say scampers around like he s gay  the special effects are comedic  the acting is for the most part awful  and nothing makes any sense  br    br   overall  maybe this concept could have produced an enjoyably campy film if they put some more time and effort into it  getting rid of the ludicrous dialogue  creating characters with actual likable personalities  having some sort of logical flow to the action  and maybe even making demonicus a female character in a sexy gladiator outfit  but no  instead we get this senseless pile of nonsense that will bore you to death ',\n  'my wife and i like to rent really stupid horror sci fi movies and watch them with our friends for a laugh  we saw this one on fullmoondirect com and decided to add it to our netflix list  now  when i say this movie is awful  i mean it in a good way  everything about it  the acting  camera work  story  costumes  is just so cheezy and low budget but thats what makes it so good  i think in one scene the actors looked like they were actually walking in place  i really hope that whoever made this film wasn t serious when they made it because if they were  then that would just be sad  if you like to watch really stupid horror movies just to make fun of them then i recommend this one ',\n  'this movie is so awful  it is hard to find the right words to describe it  br    br   at first the story is so ridiculous a narrow minded human can write a better plot  the actors are boring and untalented  perhaps they were compelled to play in this cheesy film  br    br   the camera receptions of the national forest are the only good in this whole movie  i should feel ashame  because i paid for this lousy picture  br    br   hopefully nobody makes a sequel or make a similar film with such a worse storyline    ',\n  'i mean really  how could charles band the head of full moon let a total stink ball like demonicus out  i mean it should never got the green light to begin with  the story is repetitive  the characters are weak at best  there is no real story on tyranus other then he s a bad dude  then they writer or director goes out his way for a bad ending  that s right a bad ending  demonicus rises  the last survivor escapes a deadly cave in  then a picture of chimera comes to life  cheaply i might add and chases her out  then as she is walking home ala funhouse  a statue that has been destroyed centuries ago reappears for no reason just to collapse on top of her  i mean  that makes no sense  what the hell was charles thinking allowing this pile of puke to be made  with four different movie companies they were that desperate for movies  they could have asked me  i had better ideas then demonicus  thanksgiving turkey ',\n  'this movie is about tyrannus  a gladiator who is brought back from the dead to summon tyrannus  a gladiator who must be brought back from the dead  tyrannus  we learn after about an hour  is also called demonicus  this adds much needed depth to the screenplay and calls into question our assumptions about identity  psychology and ourselves   br    br   the spirit of tyrannus accomplishes his little to do list  killing some people and saying repetitive phrases in latin  by possessing the body of a college guy  he uses a magic mind control helmet to do this  which the college boy willingly puts on his head  and then at several points in the movie  takes off and puts back on  br    br   maria performs oral sex on a poor man s sean willian scott  and tyrannus wears the rollerball glove  tyrannus has his own green backlighting for no reason  and has apparently been sitting next to cg fire in an ancient concrete tunnel for centuries like this  utter misfortune  br    br   this movie is empty and will hurt you  see it ',\n  'okay  this movie f ck in  rules  it is without question one of the most technically inept pieces of cinema ever made  absolutely terrible  but you gotta see it  rent this with your buddies and come up with a drinking game or just have fun  it s hilarious  and the behind the scenes featurette proves it  you can do anything with paper plates and finger paint  awesome  okay  rent it just for this one scene  two characters are actually walking in place for about 3 minutes in a shot  the director  on the commentary  says  yeah  the tracking was so smooth it looks like they re      yeah  right man  they are totally walking in place  it s so funny ',\n  'warning spoilers      a really stupid movie about a group of young excursionists in italy that find an armor of mythical warrior with a demonic souls  one of them wears it and becomes possessed by the spirit of a demon  it s killing time and several of his friends die under his blade to revive the demon corpse  br    br   a waste of time for the viewers  as the fine young ladies in the movie leave their clothes on  the gore is ludicrous at best  and the acting is terrible  perfect pairing for such a bad script br    br   ',\n  'for some reason  various young couples hiking through the italian alps split up to see who can reach their campsite designation first  james  gregory lee kenyon  enters a cave  finds a skeleton of an ancient demonic gladiator and becomes possessed by the spirit of  tyranus  when he puts on a helmet belonging to the corpse  he then spends the rest of the film running around in the woods hunting down his friends and hacking off their limbs to add to some stew to bring the undead  demonicus  back to life  this shot on digital full moon release is stupid  senseless  has terrible acting and sound and the  los  angeles national forest is a poor substitute for italy  however  it s pretty high on the unintentional laugh scale thanks mainly to the overwrought lead performance  whether bug eyed running around in cheap looking armor brandishing a sword or spouting neurotic latin gibberish about demons and resurrection  kenyon s ridiculous facial expressions and awkward line delivery must be seen to be believed  oh well  at least he s not boring like most of the rest of the cast ',\n  'this film is exactly what you get when you really over stretch your abilities  it s like someone who has just passed there driving test and then pitting them in a formula 1 grand prix  not i might add  the us grand prix as everyone might pull out due to dodgy tyres and you might just win   that is how far short this film falls  now don t take this the wrong way  i love b movies  around half my collection is made of b movies but i don t think there are enough letters in the alphabet to describe how bad this film is  br    br   first of the story  for a b movie  isn t that bad  it has potential there to make a b movie brand  were not talking friday 13th potential  but potential none the less  but what really lets this film down is the acting  at not one second do i believe anything  it s like watching qvc except the presenters on qvc tend to have a heavier tan  br    br   in summary i d like to say i ve seen worse films  but i can t ',\n  'i rented this one to see vanesa talor one more time  she can act  but doesn t get a chance in this clunker  the opening sequence is an elaborate crane shot of mountain landscapes  must have come from a stock archive  because the movie is shot direct to videotape  the production values make  blair witch  look professional  there s a really cheesy animated statue  but no other effects worth noting  this movie is bad  but not amusingly so  the players would do well not to mention it on their resumes ',\n  'seriously  i just wrapped up my first viewing of demonicus and words have failed me  br    br   i remember a time when i would see charles band s name on a film and my heart would race  he was never a wes craven or a john carpenter  he was a bastion of hope for the little man  the guy whose movies arrived at the video store instead of the multiplex  but they still rocked harder than most of the trendy junk we otherwise had to endure  br    br   and now    this  br    br   a painfully obvious californian walking trail doubles for  the alps  and an abandoned train tunnel is actually supposed to be  an ancient cave   i mean  they didn t even try to dress the thing up with moss or film it in a way that might suggest it was anything other than an old train tunnel  ugh  instead of a creepy demon gladiator  as the cover implies  we re treated to a dude wearing the latest in wal mart halloween apparel  there s a pretty cool looking corpse  who occasionally comes to life to belch and wiggle his fingers  but he doesn t even learn to stand until the final five minutes  why couldn t he be the villain  instead  we ve got frat boy joe with a plastic sword  ouch  br    br   charles band    you should be ashamed that your name is attached to such tripe  i love movies that are so bad  they re good  hell  i occasionally enjoy a flick thats so bad  its just bad  this one  however  is just unwatchable  a perfect example of making a buck  rather than making a quality film ',\n  ...],\n [0,\n  0,\n  0,\n  0,\n  0,\n  0,\n  0,\n  0,\n  0,\n  0,\n  0,\n  0,\n  0,\n  0,\n  0,\n  0,\n
